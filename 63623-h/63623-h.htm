<h2>NOTE</h2>


<p>In these pages the story of the pearl is told
from its birth and growth under tropic seas,
through the search for it by dark skinned divers
of the Orient and its journeyings by the
hands of men who traffic in precious things,
until it becomes finally the cherished familiar
of the great. Historical and traditional allusions,
the sentiment and superstitions, the
romance of ancient and noble associations,
drawn to it through the ages, are garnered here
and to them added the more prosaic facts which
a merchant's experience suggests, to enable
lovers of the dainty sea-gem to discriminate.
The qualities which make some pearls of great
value and the imperfections which render
others less valuable are described in detail,
that owners and buyers may appreciate at their
true value the gems they have or would purchase
and the market price of all kinds is given.
Means for the detection of imitations are
included.</p>

<p>Long time has been given to microscopic
research and though much remains to be learned
of the genesis of the pearl, it is hoped that
something of value has been added to the
knowledge of Nature's wonderful and curious
processes whereby through the humblest she
makes a jewel fit to adorn the most beautiful
of her creaturesâ€”woman.</p>

<p>My thanks are due Messrs. Combes &amp; Van
Roden of Philadelphia for the loan of the
original photographs from which were made the
reproductions of the portraits of Queen Alexandra,
The Marchioness of Londonderry, Countess
Torby and Princess Lazareff, which will, I
trust, be of great interest to lovers of pearls:
also to Mr. Ludwig Stross for much valuable
information about Oriental pearl fisheries.</p>

<h2>AT THE BOTTOM OF THE<br />
DEEP BLUE SEA</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">The sea in all her moods has a strange
fascination for the children of the dry
land. The rumble and thunder of her never
ending procession of rolling breakers, rising
and falling, tumbling over the sands, to race
hissing back to shelter under the curling crest
of an eternal successor; the mad recurring dash
which cannot be discouraged, of great waters
upon unyielding rocks whose grim faces smile at
the spume fountains falling back upon them;
the wash and mutter of rocky shoals; the suck
and bellow of her caverns and the monotone
she chants, heedless of hearers to the ages; all
these charm the hearts of men and bring them
into the fellowship of spirits they feel, but
cannot understand. For the moods of the sea
and the ways of the wind are akin to the heart
of a man. His eyes dance with the flicker of
light in the path of the sun over watery wastes;
his breast heaves in unison with the multitudinous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
swellings of the sea; he finds peace in
the slumber of her calms and exults in her mad
race before the drive of the tempest, but he
seldom thinks below the surface and knows
little of the things she hides in her deeps.
Yet a world lives there, very strange and
full of enchantments. Sheltered under the
breasts of the sea and undisturbed by the
furies of the upper world, myriads of living
creatures, graceful, beautiful, wonderful, traverse
the peaceful depths. In the vast and
fathomless solitudes, things grow and take on
form, meet for the eyes of the gods. In everlasting
touch with soft currents, trees of coral
grow from rocky beds and finny tribes of every
shape and hue glide in and out among their
fantastic branches. Water covering all, on
hills, plateaus, shelving stretches, sandy bars
and rocky shoals; in valleys, chasms and even
in the dread abysses, are things as strange to
man as Jupiter or Saturn holds; weird as the
creatures of our dreams; uncanny as the pictures
a riotous imagination paints and some as
beautiful.</p>

<p>Near the shore and a few miles out, where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>bottom of the sea is but a few fathoms deep and
where man can go and come and live, there are
among other marvellous creations, shells of
wonderful structure and beautiful to look upon.
One by one these have been discovered during
past ages by the adventurous and for their
usefulness or beauty have awakened the desire
of those who dwell upon the earth. The chank,
the sacred shell of the Hindus, has been used
by the priests of Buddha for centuries as a
horn to call the faithful. Shankar the Destroyer,
of Hindu mythology, and Vishnu, each
hold a chank shell in one of their hands.</p>

<p>The shell whorl usually runs from left to
right, sometimes it is found with the whorl
reversed and these were so highly regarded by
Hindus, Cingalese and Chinese that in old
times they were sold for their weight in gold.
Even now they bring a good price in the eastern
markets. They are kept in the pagodas of
China to hold the sacred oil: the priests of Ceylon
administer medicine by them. In Dacca
the chank is cut into armlets and anklets for
Hindu women upon whose persons they are
left after death. The delicate pink cameos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>carved from the Queen Conch have delighted
feminine eyes of almost every race. The Pearly
Nautilus decks many a dainty lady's table
and is wrought into a thousand quaint conceits.
The silky byssus of the Pinna has been woven
into fabrics of such fineness as to be thought
worthy of acceptance by Popes and princes.</p>

<p>Before Europe knew of their existence, the
people of China and Japan, the Maoris of New
Zealand, the Indians of our Pacific coast and the
brown skinned natives of far-off islands of the
Southern Seas, were delighting themselves with
the magnificent coloring and iridescence of the
Haliotis even as ancient Greece and Rome made
ornaments from the "Venus Ear-shell," as
they called it, brought from the ruder coasts
and islands further west. In these later days
the costly outer garments of proud dames are
ornamented with buttons cut from the same
resplendent shell. But of all the beautiful
things old ocean pays as tribute to the adventurous
spirit of man, the pearl-oyster and the
gem found sometimes in it are most precious.</p>

<p>From unknown times when man discovered
them until now, mother-of-pearl shells and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>their pearly treasures have held desire constant
and the eyes of modern queens brighten
when the opening of the gift casket reveals a
string of these spheres of beauty just as eyes
did in the far-off Indies thousands of years ago.
When Europe was a land of barbarians and
America an unknown country of savages,
dusky fingers that held the life and destiny of
millions, toyed lovingly with pearls, even as
now the favored few who enter the sanctum
sanctorum of fortune, pride themselves in the
possession of them and find pleasure for cloyed
desire, in every addition to their store.</p>

<p>In all ages, pearls have been the social insignia
of rank among the highly civilized. No other
gem was so abundantly used for adornment by
the princes of the east. Above great diamonds
from the mines of India or glowing rubies from
Burmah, the ocean gem became peerless among
the ancient nations of Asia and as their power
began to wane and the tide of empire swept
westward, there went with it the love of pearls.
The rulers of Rome when she was Empress of
the world sought pearls, so also have the rich
and powerful of every nation as it rose to affluence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and now in this new western star of
Empire the men who hold the vast wealth of
these United States in their hands, when they
place their consorts on the last plane of social
eminence, buy pearls.</p>

<p>Before the machine-like system of modern
industry had combined ownership and seized
the vast natural reservoirs which hold the diamonds
of Africa, and brought the output to a
known average yield of so many carats to so
many loads, and established the cost of mining,
washing, shipping and marketing, separately
or together, to the fraction of a penny, there
was a fascination in the hunt for diamonds
there, the charm of which drew thousands to
the fields.</p>

<p>From the discovery of them as baubles in
the hands of children and the Hottentots,
or plastered in the mud walls of Boer farm-houses
through the search for them along
the Vaal River, to the time where findings led
men to the kopjes, which capped the great
chimneys of diamond bearing clay, where they
staked and worked their individual claims, the
ever present hope of finding a royal gem among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>the small stones which formed the every-day
yield, gave edge to appetite and the spur to
toil, and the stories of fortunes diverted from
one man to another by the lapse of a few
minutes at the beginning or expiration of a
lease, or by the line separating the mining
rights of one from another, read like fairy tales.</p>

<p>More exciting yet is the search for them
when, as in Brazil, they lie scattered over the
river beds where one man hunts in vain and another
by chance stumbles upon a pocket full,
or as in India, where one must dig for them
blindly into detrital matter ten or twelve feet
under a later covering of earth. Who has not
felt the stir of it while reading of miners in
Brazil using diamonds worth a king's ransom
as counters in their games of chance, or of a
naked Hindu, emaciated and diseased carrying
about his person, wrapped in a bit of soiled
cloth, a gem found by chance which the richest
prince of India would covet. So also do the
tales of rubies brought from Death's Valley of
Burmah renew within us the glow which fired
the heart of youth when we read of Aladdin
and his lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p>But none of these are so redolent of romance
as the story of the pearl. Beneath the rolling
of the sea, where the waves pace softly and
restlessly like caged lions, or lift themselves
roaring to answer the voice of the storm; where
at times the water lies green and placid under
burning skies; at times, lashed by tornado and
monsoon, becoming a seething caldron of black
perdition; where spice-laden vessels sail, and
where in the old days, privateers and pirates
lay in wait for prey, there, at the bottom of the
sea, unruffled by storm or pirate, unmindful of
sun and calm, myriads of delicate creatures toil
ceaselessly to strew old ocean's bed with gems.
The chaste spheres with which you toy, while
counting up the cost of hanging them round
some fair neck, at one time lay fathoms deep,
the ocean rolling over them. Dusky fishermen,
at risk of life, brought them up and turbanned
merchants gave great sums of money to own
them; ships carried them, and dealers in
precious things handled, sorted, examined and
matched them, ere they came to rest in festooned
rows within the velvet covers your
jeweller opens to you.</p>

<h2>A PEARL OF LEGEND</h2>


<p>Long ago, ere the great Nations of Europe
came into existence; before Rome was, or
Greece had made history: when the power of
the Earth dwelt in the lands of the Sun and
was for good or evil in the hands of princes,
there lived in Travancore a ruler of renown.
Of those who came from the north, he with his
followers had subjugated the fierce native tribes
inhabiting the country for many miles along
the seacoast and back to the mountainous
interior. Over all, to the utmost bounds of his
territory, the land was fertile and very beautiful.
Along the shores, but a short distance from
the ocean, were numerous shallow stretches of
water, formed by the meeting of the inland
streams with the swift current of the sea which
there sweeps the coast. In them fish abounded,
yet were they free from the dangers of the outer
waters, so that young and old could there
disport themselves without fear. Though the
tropic heat was often great there were no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>parched and barren wastes in the land, for the
rains were many and the streams which ran
to the sea from the mountains were numerous.
Everywhere luxuriant verdure swayed to
breezes that played to and fro over the rolling
lowlands and about the hillsides, now coming
from the water and now from the mountains.
Coffee, rice, the palm, cocoanut, the areca-nut,
the pepper, tamarind, and other tropical fruits
and trees grew in rank abundance, and huge
forest timbers sheltered many noble creatures
of the wild.</p>

<p>At the first coming of this prince, fighting was
constant and bloody. The hill tribes, more
war-like than those of many lands, made frequent
descents from their fastnesses, seeking by
every ruse of barbarous warfare to exterminate
the intruder. But this man was wary and
alert. Possessing the confidence of his followers,
they obeyed him with unquestioning obedience.
Quick to move, merciless in his reprisals, he
was soon feared by all the surrounding country
and as it became known that he was also just
and generous, peace presently followed.</p>

<p>Then did he seek to establish his kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>wisely and well. He encouraged his subjects to
cultivate the land, to fish the waters, and to
trade with those who came by ship and over-land
bringing all manner of things for barter.</p>

<p>Though he and his people were devout
believers in the Veda, yet did he tolerate the
faith of others, and considered the low-born,
for Brahmanism had not yet established the
extremes of caste which came later. He himself
was a Kshattriya but he ruled the Brahmans
and would not permit injustice to the Sudras,
therefore was he as a god among his people.</p>

<p>And this prince was good to look upon. Tall
and straight as a tree of the forest, the fine
lines of his grave impassive face were made
alive by the light of eyes keen as an eagle's,
inscrutable as those of a lion when he looks
beyond.</p>

<p>One son only had he, for the others had all
fallen in battle. The son was like the sire, and
the father's heart was knit to him as steel when
it is welded.</p>

<p>Now the time came when it was good that
the young prince should marry, for he was
man-grown and had been invested with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>sacrificial cord. So the prince his father said to
him, "My son, thou standest alone to guard the
manes of thy fathers. It is meet that the sons
of my son be alive upon the earth, that when the
time is come I die in peace and return to the
place from whence I came, in confidence. I
will find for thee a wife." And the young prince
answered, "Let it be as my lord
wills."</p>

<p>Now there was in the country beyond the
hills, on the eastern coast of India, a prince
whose daughter was famed for her beauty and
he also was Kshattriya. To him the ruler of
Travancore sent certain of those who were near
him, and a wise priest in whom he had great
confidence, to treat with the father of the maid.
And these when they had arrived, made haste
to do their lord's bidding, nor was it difficult to
obtain his desire, for the prince of Travancore
was in great repute. So as soon as could be,
the maid become the wife of the heir of
Travancore.</p>

<p>Report had not lied concerning the beauty of
the girl, and such other qualities had she that
the heart of her husband melted to her and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>became as the gold of a jewel when it holds a
ruby most precious.</p>

<p>In due time a son was born to them, and the
father and his sire and all the people with them
were exceeding glad, for said they, "Now is
wisdom and power established on the throne of
Travancore and a son's son will guard the name
of our lord."</p>

<p>Now when the princess was a maid in the
land of her father, a Rover from the coast of
Kandy had greatly desired her, and when she
was carried away to Travancore he was very
wroth. It was told that he would seek vengeance,
but another year passed and another
son came and both the children and the mother
thrived.</p>

<p>But one day, when many sea-boats lay
within the harbor of a city of Travancore where
much trading was done with men who came
from far-off countries and when multitudes were
gathered there, it chanced that the princess
passed by the market-place. Suddenly, a great
number of them that were there from foreign
shores, gathered together, and drawing swords,
rushed upon the guards which accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>her. These, with the bearers they over-powered,
and ere the bewildered populace knew the
meaning of the tumult, the princess was dragged
from her attendants and hurried to a boat
waiting and ready to sail. Immediately this
glided swiftly toward the sea followed by many
others manned by ruffians who had lately
mingled with the men on shore as peaceful
traders. They were followers of the Kandy
Rover.</p>

<p>In a very little while, the King, with the
trusted priest of his household, the prince and
many picked men of the King's body-guard
rode furiously to the water-side. The face of
the King was very stern, but only in the flashings
of his eyes could be seen the unrelenting
vengeance which moved him. Quietly he gave
orders to man his ships of war. Then it was
found that every one of them had been damaged.
Not until the sailors made ready to sail were
the hindrances observable, and in no case was
the evil great, or so that it could not be presently
repaired, for fearing discovery the doers
of it sought only to delay the sailing of the
King's ships, as the ships of the Rover were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>swift, and after they were out of the harbor,
Travancore had none which could overtake
them. Then was the wrath of the King terrible
to look upon.</p>

<p>Now while the prince and his followers chafed,
and the dismayed populace watched the work
of the men who sought to make the boats ready
to sail, the King filled them with the fiercest of
his soldiers, being resolved that if the pirate
escaped him on the sea he would follow him
to his lair with swift and overwhelming vengeance.
While these things were being done, the
Rover passed out to the open sea and in sight
of all the people turned his prows to the south.</p>

<p>Then the Brahman, standing where the
lapping waters encircled his feet, stretched
forth his hands toward the white sails as they
spread to the west wind and called upon Shankar
to destroy the despoiler. Immediately the wind
died out and the ships were becalmed. Then
the heart of the King swelled with fierce joy.</p>

<p>At his orders all the lighter boats were filled
with men and oars were provided that they
might row to the attack, and the young prince
stood in the front of the fastest one. But while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>the people whetted themselves for battle, the
Brahman still stood and prayed. And presently
the air became thick. Though no clouds
appeared the sky faded rapidly from sight, and
the sun could no more be seen and the light of
it was as the color of fire in thick smoke only.</p>

<p>Darkness as of chaos and a silence like that
of a dead world encompassed the people, and
a great dread gripped them. Suddenly there
came from the sea a breath of sighing broken
by sobs very heartrending, and this was followed
by the sound of churning and lashing water.
Soon a furious wind swept the coast in gusts
which rested only that they might gather
strength to rage, as the rush of rioters is
momentarily stayed between whiles. And the
black air, writhing like smoke, was driven
hither and thither, and shaken by the din of
thunder. Fierce lightnings pierced the darkness
and in passing gave lurid glimpses of the sea's
frenzy and the wind-swept earth. But though
the storm raged so that the roaring sickened the
hearts of the people, the Brahman remained unmoved,
his hands stretched toward the sea where
the Rover and his fleet were when it began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>Presently the wind passed, and the people
looking seaward saw that there were no ships
there, but the foam of the surf was black with
wreckage, and tossing in it were the forms of
dead men. The Rover and his followers had
all perished. But the joy of the King and his
people was savage, and their thoughts were
black, for the princess was with them that were
destroyed. Then the people made haste to
spread themselves along the coast to watch if
perchance the gods might cast her ashore alive,
but no living thing appeared, neither was her
body seen.</p>

<p>Now while these things were being done,
great clouds, very thick and black, gathered,
and rolling together, poured themselves in
torrents into the sea. So thickly did the rain
fall that the waves were beaten down and the
sea became as a threshing-floor on which the
rain fell white and hissing. The Brahman
watching, said "Behold! the Heavens weep,"
and turning, he went straightway to the temple.</p>

<p>For many hours thereafter did the torrents fall
and all Travancore mourned, the lamentations of
the people being very loud, for the King and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>son were much beloved and it was known that
the prince was sorely distressed, and the more so
that his sword must needs be idle for there were
none left upon whom he could take vengeance.</p>

<p>Now when the elements were at peace again,
the King gave orders that certain fishermen of
his people who were expert divers, should
explore the bottom of the sea where the ships
of the Rover were destroyed. One of these
discovered the body of the princess and brought
it to shore. And when they prepared it for
burial, the women found fastened upon one of
the hands a shell-fish, the two shells of which
had closed upon a finger when it fell between
them as they gaped. And when the shells
were pried apart, there rolled from between
them a round bone, white and shining, yet of a
luster so soft and beautiful that no man had
seen the like. And the Brahman when he saw
it said, "Herein are the tears of Heaven which
fell into the sea congealed and have become a
gem which is beyond price." And he named it
"Pearl," and carried it to the King. Then the
King after he had heard the story of it, sent for
the chief man of them that worked in gold and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>commanded him that he make for the pearl a
setting most precious, and when it was done he
gave it to the prince his son saying, "Above
all things let this be first among the jewels of
Travancore for-ever." And the prince when
he looked upon it said, "The beauty of it is
like the brightness of her eyes when they veiled
themselves before my passion," and he prized
it more than all the diamonds and rubies in
his treasure-house.</p>

<p>From that day, when the fishermen dived
for the chank, they sought also for shells like
unto that in which the King's pearl was found,
and after great rains many more pearls were
brought from the depths of the sea, and fishermen
following the coast, found them on the
shoals between India and Kandy in great plenty.
These were carried to the King, for no man
dared to sell them, yet did the King reward the
finders very liberally. So the store of them in
the King's treasury grew, and for that there
were no gems like them in all the earth, the
fame of them spread, and travellers came from
many and far-off lands to look upon the pearls
of Travancore.</p>

<h2>ANTIQUITY OF THE PEARL </h2>


<p>How long the pearl has been used as a jewel
is unknown. It is seen all through the pages
of history, from the long ago days when records
were inscribed on the leaves of plants, to the
rapid-fire prints of to-day, which unceasingly
scatter to myriads the knowledge of things as
they occur.</p>

<p>Back of history, pearls loom everywhere in
the mists of tradition like delicate but imperishable
orbs of beauty set in the smoulder of burned
out days and passions. And wherever their
tranquil light attracts the eye of imagination,
the ghosts of the great are seen, for pearls lie
in the hair of royalty and clasp the fair necks
of Queens. Upon them shine the eyes of
turbanned princes who valued them above the
blood and life of thousands of subjects. Shades
of imperious fingers, long since fallen to the
elements, toy with them: they deck the spectral
gatherings of the mighty in all lands and
ages, and there is no dream of song or story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>which does not hold them among the chief
enchantments. As the fair moon hangs from
the brow of night when she broods over lonely
waters, so does the pearl shine in the shades of
the ages.</p>

<p>In this country abundant evidence exists that
before the advent of the white man, or of the
red-skins as we know them, the aborigines,
from the cold rise of the Mississippi to the glades
of Florida, used them for their adornment. In
savage wilds, and on coasts that knew not the
sight of ships or other shores, copper-skinned
natives treasured the glistening things they
found in the mollusks of the sea-shoals and
inland streams. Quantities of pearls have been
found in the Indian mounds, many of them
loose, others strung for necklaces and wristlets,
some mounted in quaint and primitive fashion,
all showing that in the days of unbroken forests
and swarming game and roving tribes of
untrammeled savages, in the tepees of the
braves, their queens wore pearls even as they
are worn now by fairer successors in the palaces
reared where once were forests and camping-grounds.
In those days the savage lords of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>undivided earth knew nothing of whirring
lathes and drills; of hardened points of steel
turning with lightning rapidity and unerring
precision. Slowly they burned a way through
the gem with hot copper wire, destroying
thereby with ruthless ignorance the delicate
beauty of jewels fit for royalty. To them the
slender prongs of gold with which the modern
jeweller holds the lustrous balls, uncovered and
in safety, were unknown. Instead, the savage
set them in holes bored in the teeth of animals,
possibly to enhance the relics of a great fight
with some fierce beast that succumbed finally
to his prowess: possibly to add beauty to the
grim reminders of her lord's valor when he
hung them round the neck of a favored mate.
The Indian of this continent was much more
primitive in the art of the jeweller than in the
manufacture of implements for war and the
chase. Gaudy colors extracted from plants and
minerals appealed more to his unthinking eye
than a chaste form of beauty. With these he
could stain his blankets, record on skins of
slaughtered animals his deeds, or paint in
hideous signs upon his face the malignancy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>war. His time and thought and ingenuity
were given to things which would contribute to
his master passion and glorify its deeds. The
scalps of his enemies, the skins of animals he
slaughtered, the feathers of birds that fell to
his unerring arrow, the teeth of bears and
mountain lions slain in desperate encounters,
these were his jewels. Nor was his sexual
instinct sufficiently refined to enthrone his mate.
She was his slave, and her reward for toil was
pride in his deeds and glory. He knew little
of the tender homage which brings gifts and
lays them at the feet of woman. Instinctively
he made a setting for his pearls of bears' teeth,
that they might carry the scent of blood and
tell the story of his conquest. Nevertheless,
among these rude tribes of wolfish savages,
sequestered from the touch of other people more
refined, the modest pearl found favor, and in
it they unconsciously paid tribute to one of
the purest forms of beauty. But even this
recognition must have been the growth of years,
possibly of ages, for not until the understanding
of worth has become general among a people is
value established, and only things valuable are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>stored. As desire for a thing for its inherent
qualities spreads, there is added a larger number
of those who seek to possess it for the profit
they can make in supplying that desire. Not
many years ago, fishermen along the streams of
remote parts of Kentucky had no eye for the
beauty of a pearl, and no knowledge that men
and women lived who prized them. If while
fishing, the fisherman's hook fell between the
gaping valves of a mollusk it was immediately
seized. The disgusted angler thereupon angrily
pulled the nuisance out, and if upon disengaging
the hook from the bivalve, he found within the
shells a pearl, it was immediately tossed back
into the stream for luck; for the beginning of
a day's sport with a catch of that kind was ill-luck
and the fates could only be appeased by
the finding of a pearl, or a "mussel egg" as
he would call it, in the mollusk, and its return
to the water. There lives yet on the banks of
the Clinch River, an old pearler, the distress of
many a speculator for his knowledge of pearls
and their value, who sometimes sorrowfully
relates how he thus in bygone years angrily
threw away many good pearls, one of them the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>finest "ball" pearl he has ever seen. If these
gems were so regarded by the ignorant white
settlers of the west until the advent of men who
had learned to appreciate them either for their
beauty or the price they would bring from the
outside world, it may be surmised that the
awakening of the ancient Indian to their beauty,
must have been a much slower process, unassisted
as it was by men from beyond their
limits who had long regarded them as precious.
At first, probably, pearls were thrown to the
children as playthings, as diamonds were in
the Cape: then the young squaws gradually
opened their eyes to the fact that the white
shining things enhanced the charms of their
smooth copper skins by contrast: the brave
sought them to please the maid he would bring
to his tepee: perhaps rovers brought news that
in the far south, in lands of houses and teocalli
and much magnificence, or farther off among the
Incas, these baubles were prized by the chiefs.
So gradually it dawned upon some that the
"eggs" of the mollusk were beautiful, and upon
others that they could be bartered for skins,
blankets, or arrows, possibly for a pony, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>so they came to be gathered and stored and
displayed as things which enriched the owner.</p>

<p>How far back in the ages the use of pearls
on this continent extends cannot be estimated.
The discovery of them in the mounds east of the
Mississippi, which are credited to an ancient
race that finally succumbed to the similar but
more war-like red men found here when the
country was discovered by Europeans, suggests
many centuries. And the use of pearls to the
extent manifest by the discoveries, favors the
theory that the mound-builders had reached a
degree of refinement never attained by the
North American Indians of record. When white
men invaded the North American continent,
they found tribes of red men as rugged as the
coasts of New England. Inured to hardships,
despising pain, contemptuous of death, they
lived by hunting and found their chief pleasure
in the slaughter of their enemies. Camping at
will, their lodges were here to-day and there
to-morrow, and brutal if heroic, they roamed
over fields once inhabited by a race which had
passed, but left evidence that they were sufficiently
civilized to appreciate the pearl.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>In Florida and South America, the conditions,
when the country was discovered by the
Spaniards, were different. The ancient races,
corresponding with the mound-builders of the
north, undisturbed by the incursions of stronger
tribes, had continued to progress and had
reached a high degree of barbarous luxury.</p>

<p>In Mexico, when Montezuma gave audience
to Cortez, he was ablaze with gold and silver
and precious stones. His cloak and sandals
were adorned with pearls. Pearls were used to
decorate temples, canoes and even the paddles.
Indian women had great strings of them coiled
around their necks and arms, and the chiefs
used them freely on all occasions of state. It
was the same on the Colombian coasts.</p>

<p>At the island of Cubagua and on the main
coast, Columbus found great quantities of pearls,
as did De Soto and his followers when they
landed at Tampa Bay, known by the Spaniards
as "Spiritu Santo," in Florida in 1539. The Incas
of Peru also owned many fine pearls. Though
the natives of all these countries ignorantly
injured the gems by cooking the oyster to
extract them, or by their crude methods of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>boring, and reckoned them of little value as
compared with the European idea, they nevertheless
esteemed them as jewels and must have
done so for ages, for the invaders found them in
the sepulchres of the dead, so altered by the
processes of time that they retained nothing of
their original beauty.</p>

<p>From these premises therefore it can be said
of the antiquity of the pearl in this hemisphere,
that it had been used as a jewel for some
centuries before the early part of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>The European regard for the pearl at this
time may be estimated by the eagerness with
which pearls were sought on the American
continent by the adventurers of Spain, and by
the pains they took on the arrival here of a new
expedition, to convey assurances to the King
of Spain that pearls were to be had in the new
conquest. In the commission appointing De
Soto to the governorship of Cuba, and as
adelantado of Florida, Charles <abbr title="5">V</abbr>. stipulated that
of the gold, silver, stones and pearls, obtained
by barter or in battle or otherwise, a certain
portion should be reserved for the Crown.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>In all the courts of Europe during the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the pearl was,
if not the chief, one of the most prominent
jewels. Mary, Queen of Scots, possessed a
rosary of pearls which excited the envy of
Catherine de MÃ©dicis and Elizabeth of England,
both of whom sought diligently to acquire them
when the Scotch Queen became mired by
misfortune.</p>

<p>The virgin queen of England when she
went in state to chapel, wore pendent pearls
in her ears after the fashion of Rome, and
borders of large pearls fastened on her dress.
When in her time Sir Thomas Gresham of
London, a wealthy subject, wished to show the
Spanish Ambassador, who had boasted of the
magnificence of his Sovereign's court, how
prodigal her liege subjects could be in her honor,
nothing occurred to him more striking than to
grind to powder a large pearl and mix it with
the wine he drank to her health. This act of
the English merchant shows that the pearl was
then regarded by the great as the acme of
costliness and beauty.</p>

<p>From the reign of Francis <abbr title="1">I</abbr>. of France to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>of Louis <abbr title="13">XIII</abbr>. the pearl was prominent in all
jewels of note, and from that time to the death
of Maria Theresa of Austria toward the close of
the eighteenth century, it was worn in preference
to all other gems. It was during the reign
of Louis <abbr title="13">XIII</abbr>. that Tavernier, the celebrated
French Jeweller and traveller, assisted by that
monarch, made his journeys into Asia. The
account of his travels, published later, are
highly esteemed for their truthfulness, and are
regarded as exact, if prosaic statements of fact.</p>

<p>The desire for the gem in Europe at this time
was so great that Tavernier purchased over half
a million dollars' worth from the Arabian Sea.
Probably the immense quantities of pearls sent
to Spain from the Indies by her rovers in the
early part of the sixteenth century, caused the
vogue of that gem during the three centuries
following, for not much mention is made of
them in western Europe prior to that time.
Nevertheless pearls were esteemed in the
British Isles as early as the eleventh century,
for it is recorded that Gilbert, Bishop of
Limerick, sent a present of Irish pearls from
the fishery at Omagh, to Anselm, Archbishop of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>Canterbury, about 1094, and Scotch pearls were
not only in demand in Britain but on the
continent also as early as the twelfth century.
In 1355, the Parisian goldsmiths forbade by
statute, workers in gold and silver to set Scotch
pearls with the Oriental.</p>

<p>The Oriental pearl probably came into
Europe first from Egypt through the incursions
of the Macedonians into that country. Later,
when Alexander overran Persia his followers
doubtless became yet more familiar with the
gem, for they spread through Arabia and the
Persian Gulf where ancient fisheries also existed.</p>

<p>Pearls were not well known west and north of
Asia and Africa at this time, for a writer of
Mytilene in the island of Lesbos, about 350 B.C.,
which was but a few years before Alexander's
conquest of Persia, says: "In the Indian Sea,
off the coasts of Armenia, Persia, Susiana and
Babylonia, a fish like an oyster is caught, from
the flesh of which men pick out white bones
called by them 'pearls'." This would indicate
that knowledge of them was being carried at
that time by returning soldiers, camp-followers
and travellers, and these men probably brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>home also many of the "white bones" obtained
by trade or looting. Whatever the method by
which they were introduced, pearls came into
favor, and the favor increased as they were
brought with other jewels from the looted
treasuries of eastern potentates. The Macedonians
established fisheries in the Red Sea,
where the Egyptians obtained their chief supply,
and the Romans later brought them also from
the Arabian Sea.</p>

<p>Three centuries B.C., the power of the
Macedonians commenced to wane; Rome began
to rise and overrun the countries which had
been subject to the Macedonians; and pearls
were thereby carried further west. The Romans
adopted the pearl as a jewel of the first importance
if not the chief of all, probably because
they had found them so regarded by the older
royalties they plundered. As the riches of
surrounding and far-off countries which she
raided, poured into the coffers of Rome, and
the city grew to be the centre of power and
wealth, the excesses of the rich became ludicrous
to the verge of insanity. In their wild
extravagances the pearl was prominent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p>Affected doubtless by the splendor of Asiatic
courts, the rude soldiers of Rome learned to
regard the pearl as a royal luxury, and therefore
adopted it as a sign of great wealth and power.
Enormous sums were paid for pearls of rare size
and beauty. Great leaders of men vied with
each other in the effort to add to their collections.
It is said that Julius CÃ¦sar's chief
incentive for pushing his conquests into the
west so far, was his desire to obtain the pearls
to be found in the streams of the British Isles.
The Emperor Caligula decked his favorite
horse with a necklace of pearls. Pliny says of
Lollia Paulina, Caligula's wife, that he had seen
her so bedecked with pearls and precious stones
that "she glittered and shone like the sun as
she went." Clodius, the glutton, claiming for
them a very delicate flavor, placed one by the
plate of each guest at a great banquet to be
mixed with the wine. This same profligate,
either setting the example or emulating
Cleopatra, swallowed in a cup of wine one worth
eight thousand pounds that he might have the
pleasure of consuming so much value at once.</p>

<p>If in the intrigues so common then, a woman's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>influence was required, pearls were given her.
To convey an indirect bribe to a man of high
station a pearl of great price was presented to
a member of his family. Women wore them
while they slept that they might possess them
in their dreams; they hung them in loose
clusters suspended from the ears, that the
tinkling might remind them of the beauty they
could not see, and to attract the admiration
and envy of others. These were called "crotalia,"
meaning "rattles." Young men of
fortune in Athens and Rome followed the
Persian fashion of wearing one in the right ear,
hung as a clapper in a small bell of metal. So
strong and general did the desire to own them
become that CÃ¦sar forbade unmarried women,
and women under a certain rank, to wear them.</p>

<p>Perhaps never in the history of jewels has the
vogue of one so nearly approached a frenzy as
that of the pearl in Rome during her days of
extreme power and grandeur. The high esteem
in which it was held there is reflected in the
Scriptures. The Saviour used it in His parables
as a symbol. The gates of the Holy City, as
the prophet John saw it in his vision, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>pearls. From that time until now, writers have
used pearls to symbolize purity, innocence and
the highest type of feminine beauty. To say
that a woman's teeth were like pearls has been
the poets' favorite adulation, and the discovery
and sale of great pearls has been deemed of
sufficient importance by travellers and historians
to record them.</p>

<p>Much of the literature of pearls is founded on
the statements of Pliny regarding them: many,
if not most, of the absurd beliefs as to their
origin and superstitions concerning them, may
be traced to the same source; and though these
ancient errors have been repeatedly exposed by
later scientists and naturalists the poetic absurdities
of the industrious Roman compiler, gathered
from contemporaneous writers and tradition
are current to-day, for they appeal more
to the child-like human love of the indefinite
wonderful than the exact statements of research,
though the latter are really more
marvellous.</p>

<p>Though jewels are regarded by many as
baubles and of little account among the great
commercial interests of the world, they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>been an important factor in shaping the destiny
of nations, changing the borders of great
countries and thereby aiding the progress of
civilization. As pearls helped materially to
bring Rome to the British Isles and the colonists
of Spain to South America, so it is quite
probable that the pearls of Egypt had their
influence in drawing the Macedonians to that
country, to be followed by the Romans when
the latter sought to overturn the Macedonian
empire. Beyond this, their influence among
those who held the reins in the government of
empires, or those having power with them that
did, cannot be estimated.</p>

<p>Passing beyond the days of Greece and Rome
to more remote times and countries, we come to
the realms of conjecture. We know that pearls
were known and used as jewels in Egypt under
the Ptolemies. Chares of Mytilene mentioned
that they were worn by women of the East
about the neck and arms and even upon the
feet. It is said there is a word for them in a
Chinese dictionary four thousand years old.</p>

<p>There is evidence that they had been used in
India and the far East long before the West had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>knowledge of those countries, but we have
nothing recorded which penetrates the past
beyond three to four hundred years B.C., for
there is not as much mention made of them in
ancient writings familiar to the West as of
other precious stones. Nevertheless the pearl is
among the most ancient in the nomenclature of
jewels because when it did come to be written
of only the one thing could be meant. Nature
produces nothing similar with which it could be
confounded, whereas it is not certain that the
diamond, ruby, and other stones as we know
them, were intended when the names by which
we designate them were used. Such indiscriminate
use of names has been made by
translators that it is difficult to determine what
the stones really were about which ancient
authors wrote. The names of those in the
Jewish High Priest's breastplate, given in our
English version of the Old Testament, undoubtedly
misrepresent the stones actually used, and
the only thing authorities agree upon regarding
the names is that they are incorrect.</p>

<p>As there was no definite knowledge of the
crystallography and chemistry of stones in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>the old days, writers referred to them often
in general terms rather than by specific names,
and these were translated into the names of
later times according to the understanding
of the translator, who had neither expert
knowledge of his own nor reliable literature
from which to gather information or
guidance. An illustration of this general confusion
occurs in the book of Job <abbr title="28">XXVIII</abbr>. 18.
It is written there, "No mention shall be made
of coral, or of pearls; for the price of wisdom is
above rubies." Scholars tell us that the words
translated here "coral" and "pearls," signify
"found in high places," and are thought to be
precious stones though the variety is unknown.
The Targum renders the first "Sandalchin,"
probably our sardonyx. Junius and Tremellius
translated it "Sandaztros" in their Latin version
of the Old Testament, whereas Pliny
described it as a sort of carbuncle having shining
golden drops in the body of it.</p>

<p>After the same manner the last sentence, "For
the price of wisdom is above rubies" is rendered
by the great oriental scholar Bochart, "The
extraction of wisdom is greater than the extraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of pearls," and other authorities agree with
him.</p>

<p>Although there is evidence that many if not
all the precious stones of to-day were known
and used by the ancients, it is equally evident
that they were much confounded and very
roughly classified by general appearance only,
and as various peoples gave them different
names, all records of them are as misleading as
the recorders were ignorant of their differential
qualities. Even with the rapid increase of
knowledge in the last few centuries, not until
quite lately has science drawn the lines clearly
between stones similar in appearance though
essentially different and furnished means for the
detection of those inherent differences. It is
impossible therefore to learn by ancient writings
how long any of the precious stones have
been known and used as jewels, for we do not
know positively what the stone was by the name
given in old writings or by the translator of
them. The pearl only has not been thus generally
confounded with other gems.</p>

<p>Once only are pearls mentioned in the Old
Testamentâ€”the instance quoted from the book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>of Job. It would seem therefore, that although
used as jewels, they were not regarded as of
great value in the East prior to about 400
years B.C., at which time the last of the sacred
Jewish books is supposed to have been written.
True, royalty wore them in Egypt and the
people of Persia and Arabia used them very
generally for personal adornment; but they
were abundant in those countries and there had
been no demand for them beyond their borders,
therefore, though beautiful, they were common
and not appreciated fully. Upon the influx of
foreign invaders from shores that yielded no
such gems their status changed rapidly. The
greedy avidity with which Greeks and Romans
seized them, and the demand for them from the
West which came later, gave these natives
of pearl-producing shores a new idea of the
value of their pearls and the trinkets became
gems.</p>

<p>It was a condition similar to that which arose
nineteen hundred years later when the Spaniards
invaded America. At their first coming
the natives gave them freely large quantities
of pearls and gleefully traded magnificent gems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>for broken pieces of gaudily painted and varnished
porcelain. As one to-day might take a
new acquaintance for a day's fishing to a
well-stocked stream, so the Indians took the
Spaniards to the pearl banks to show them how
they obtained their pearls. With pleasure and
probably some amusement, they watched the
eagerness with which the strangers sought the
pearls, and doubtless wondered at the gratification
displayed when they found any.</p>

<p>The Egyptians and Asiatics being more highly
civilized undoubtedly valued their pearls more
than the South American Indians did, but
naturally they would not appreciate them so
highly as they did after foreign desire had
depleted their hoards and established a constant
demand for them, greater than the yield
of their fisheries.</p>

<p>That this condition prevailed in Egypt and
Asia prior to the advent of Europeans, is indicated
by the apparent ignorance of the writer
of the book of Job concerning pearls. The
word used in Chapter <abbr title="28">XXVIII</abbr>. 18 is simply the
translator's sign for an unknown quantity, and
as the pearl is an apt symbol and illustration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>many ideas connected with or embodied in the
cult of the Jewish Church, the fact that the
Jewish writers did not so use it, though the
precious metals and other precious stones were
so used, and though their books were written
in various countries, suggests that the pearl in
those days was not reckoned of equal importance
with gold and silver and stones like those
set in the Jewish High Priest's breastplate for
instance.</p>

<p>That a very considerable change in the world's
estimate of the pearl took place during the four
centuries B.C. is illustrated by the references
made to pearls in the New Testament. Rome
had made of the "white bones from a shell-fish"
of the fourth century B.C., a gem for the
rich and powerful and so generally established
it in the public estimation that the sacred writers
used it to illustrate their greatest conceptions
of beauty and spiritual worth.</p>

<p>The Saviour likened the Kingdom of Heaven
to "a pearl of great price:" under the similitude
of pearls He counseled the reservation of
holy things from men incapable of appreciating
them. Paul and John numbered them among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>the costly adornments in the pride of life and
with the most precious articles of merchandise.
From that day, with the extension of commerce,
and the growth of Western nations in affluence
and refinement, the demand for pearls grew and
spread until even the rude island of Britain
learned to appreciate them.</p>

<p>The quantities of large and beautiful pearls
stored in the treasure-houses of Hindu princes
suggest that they have existed as jewels in
India for a very long period, but for how many
centuries cannot be definitely stated. The
probability is that in very remote ages, rude
fishermen of tropic seas all over the world,
while fishing for food were attracted by the
lustrous objects found occasionally in the
oysters which they gathered and that they
saved them as things likely to please some maid
or matron of their affections. A favor for them
once established, they would be sought, and
with the growth of intelligence and refinement
would come increased appreciation. There is a
close analogy in all things between the development
of the individual and nations, and even of
the world. Each progresses on the same lines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>the difference consists in the magnitude and
duration of the processes only.</p>

<p>To the child, pearls are playthings; to youth,
pretty baubles; to mature years, important
gems; to age, most beautiful and wonderful
creations, and the more intelligent and refined
the individual, the more quickly are these
stages of regard reached.</p>

<p>So probably, in countries where they were
found, pearls have risen with the evolution of a
great nation out of a primitive race, from the
rude favor of toilers of the sea, to a high place
in the esteem of the princes of a cultivated
people. It is quite probable that when the
Aryans from the north spread over India, they
found pearls among the possessions of the
natives of the Madras and Malabar coasts, if
not of the interior and north, as Spain found
them among the natives of South America.
Having a higher order of intelligence, they
would naturally estimate the gem as of greater
value than the aborigines would.</p>

<p>As the invaders in the course of centuries
gradually divided themselves into castes, the
gem would come largely into the hands of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>highest and its value would increase with the
affluence of the ruling class, according to the
ratio existing between their wealth and that
of the average community; for the centralization
of wealth establishes a price for its imperishable
forms which debars the masses from
ownership. So, probably, the Aryans from the
north acquired the pearls they found in the
possession of the Dasyus. When the shepherd
invaders were settled in the territory they had
conquered and became divided into castes of
Vaisyas, Kshattriya and Brahman, pearls gravitated
to the upper classes, to be garnered later
by their princes as the government assumed a
tyrannical form; and so it is that the great
pearls of India found in ancient times are among
the jewels of the princes of India, or of the
Shah of Persia and the Afghan Ameers, who in
turn looted some of the richest treasuries of
India.</p>

<p>In countries east of India one can only
imagine the history of pearls for there are no
records of them. Year after year, for centuries
and cycles, in undiscovered deeps, the beds of
the sea were strewn with noble gems that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>through all their years of beauty lay neglected:
the soft luster of succeeding charms appealed in
vain for eyes which never came, and when the
slow processes of time had brought decay they
passed unseen to the catacombs of Nature.</p>

<p>So it was in many a tropic sea, on unknown
shores and about islands holding strange
creatures and stranger men. In the still, clear
waters of far-away lagoons, treasures of pearls,
released by the death of their creators, have
rolled to a resting-place on coral reefs, to lie
there until the sea, atom by atom, devoured
them. Could all the pearls hoarded by every
nation on earth be gathered together, the
mighty sum would be small compared with the
number of those which lie buried beneath the
ocean.</p>

<p>But, one by one, slant-eyed Celestials, Maoris,
Malays, Papuans, Polynesians and others, discovering,
learned to prize and hoard the pearl.
Then came men from far-off wonderlands, whose
great ships spread their sails to the winds of
the deep waters and who could endure for
many days the solitudes of the great seas.
These in the early days made war to plunder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>but were replaced as the centuries passed, by
others who gave gaudy beads and cloths of
many colors and water that fired the soul and
other wonderful things, in exchange for the
white beads of the sea, and so the pearls of the
unenlightened children of the South Seas
passed to the princes of the West, even as the
same restless spirits, spreading their sails to the
winds of the great seas in the opposite direction,
brought them east from more barbarous shores
far away to the westward.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of pearls reaches back about
twenty-three hundred years, through the writings
of Pliny, who nearly nineteen hundred
years ago gathered the facts of his day and the
rumors of traditions concerning them. Beyond
that we can only surmise that in prehistoric
ages, with the dawn of intelligence in the
infantile period of the race, men dwelling near
tropic seas were attracted by them as children
are by bright and pretty baubles; and that as
humanity by families, tribes and nations, grew
out of savagery to the mental stature of a man,
so pearls grew to be jewels very precious.</p>

<h2>THE FASHION OF PEARLS </h2>


<p>Although the pearl like all other jewels, has
had its periods of extreme and general public
favor, unlike other gems if it is once appreciated
by an individual or a nation it is never utterly
discarded by either. If not the fashion, pearls
are always in fashion. Far as we can look back
among the dim, uncertain figures of the mystic
past whose shades stand where the unknown
multitudes have fallen, we find pearls.</p>

<p>The princes of India through all their generations,
the dynasties of Egypt, the royalties of
Persia, the wild chiefs of Arab tribes, the
potentates of Greece, Rome and Venice, the
houris of Turkey, the Queens of every European
court, from the time they found a place in
history until now, all wear pearls. At first
thought this seems strange, for of all gems the
origin of the pearl is most humble. No titanic
forces, groaning in the travail of subterranean
convulsions, crushed and ground and fired its
particles to shape and beauty. It grew, a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>fathoms deep, where the waters are at peace,
in the embrace of a mollusk and out of its
exudations.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_070" name="i_070"><img src="images/i_070.jpg" alt="" width="303" height="480" /></a>
<p class="caption">PRINCESS ABAMALEK LAZAREFF<br />
(<em>From the painting by Vitelleschi</em>)</p>
</div>

<p>From this lowly parentage it rises at once to
a place among the noblest, for it is the aristocrat
of gems and finds its warmest admirers
among the aristocrats of all nations. The
favorites of fortune the world over in all ages
have succumbed to the modest beauty of the
pearl. Its ascendancy marks not alone the
refinement of the individuals with whom it finds
favor, but the high status of the nation where
it is widely appreciated. The pearl is the
favorite of those who are surfeited with jewels.
One may become tired of the diamond's
splendor, but those who learn to appreciate the
unobtrusive loveliness of the pearl, seldom lose
that fondness for them which it develops. It
is the one gem which does not satiate. The
love of pearls usually marks a connoisseur of
gems and one accustomed to the possession of
jewels. Diamonds emblazon the gates of
luxury but pearls are the familiars of the
luxurious. Glittering gems are admired by all
classes but usually the pearl is fully appreciated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>only by old countries and persons "to the manor
born." It is in the treasure-houses of the
princes of the Orient and among the jewels of
great and noble families that one must look for
the pearls gathered during the centuries. Except
in Italy and Arabia, where all classes prize them,
the pearl is not a jewel of the people, but of
the gentry and the very rich who come in contact
with them.</p>

<p>It is essentially a jewel for the wealthy.
Unostentatious, exquisite, it is insufficient for
those who have no other jewels and unfit for
common wear. Of a nature too delicate for
rough usage, it must be well cared for and
properly housed. Even then the hand of time
bears heavily upon it for it is susceptible to
many influences which do not affect other gems.
Comparatively soft, the lustrous skin is injured
by rough and careless contact with other jewels.
The gold of the setting, in time, cuts into the
surface where it binds, or if it is pierced and
strung, the rings of nacre about the orifices
gradually peel away. Hot water injures it;
gases discolor it. As the cheek of beauty grows
dim with age, so gradually the brilliancy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>youth fades from the pearl and the complexion
of it is changed. And yet it retains a certain
loveliness which may well be compared to the
exquisite serenity with which the maturer
years of some women are adorned.</p>

<p>The pearl, therefore, being essentially a jewel
of the rich, is not affected as others by the
whims of fashion. In Oriental countries, where
the lives of the masses and what little property
they hold are practically at the mercy of their
rulers, the centuries make little change in conditions
and less in fashions. The nobles have
always possessed the jewels of the various
eastern countries and the fashion continues
through generations and dynasties, to accumulate
and hold them until some stronger power
takes them away by force. As the people
hammered heavy bracelets and anklets out of
the precious metals, not alone for display, but
also to hoard them, so their princes hoarded
jewels.</p>

<p>In the old times these hoards of the precious
metals were periodically gathered by the
requisitions of the princes on the people, and
of jewels by the demands of a successful invader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>upon the princes; but while the possessors
changed, the fashion remained always the same,
and whether the Shah of Persia, the Ameer of
Afghanistan, or the Mogul, there has been no
variation in the constant desire to obtain more
jewels, pearls among them, and to display them
after the same fashion through all the generations.</p>

<p>To some extent this is true of pearls in the
Occident also. Since Rome set the fashion
there has not been a time in the history of any
European nation, once it had risen to the pearl-wearing
eminence, when the upper classes did
not wear pearls. There is this difference between
the East and the West however; whereas the
men of the East wear them, in the West, pearls
are worn almost entirely by women alone. The
more rugged life of European men, the coarser
fabrics of their garments to suit climatic needs,
and their virile distaste for effeminate display,
all combine to bar them from a jewel suited
only to soft silks and linens or the touch of
softer flesh.</p>

<p>In ancient times, among Asiatics, fashion
probably did not culminate in any direction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>as to-day, in a vogue. The inability of the
masses to follow a fashion of the upper classes,
both for lack of means and permission to do
so; the absence of all rapid methods of communication
between sections of country within
and without national borders, with the consequent
limitations of a knowledge of men and
things to community affairs, and the paucity of
manufacturing possibilities, all combined to
make fashions permanent. With the awakening
of the vigorous barbarian tribes of Europe
to a knowledge of their power, and their rapid
civilization, came the frenzied desire of men
new to the situation, to crowd as much as possible
into the span of life.</p>

<p>Rome rioted in the accumulations of ages.
With an appetite whetted by an heredity of
unsatisfied desire, she drank the finest vintages
and gourmandized the choicest morsels of the
world, immune from present punishment for
excess by a long ancestry of hard and simple
life. Every land that she could reach, sent to
her the best of all their products, and from the
incoming tide of things new to her experience,
she adopted many fashions, among them that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>of wearing pearls. For several centuries they
were in vogue, so much so that edicts were
issued restricting them to certain classes. Since
that time, the very general use of them by
persons of high station in Europe, beyond all
other gems, seems to have been confined to the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and is now
being revived at the opening of the twentieth.</p>

<p>There is one fashion of wearing pearls which
is common to all ages and races, viz. strung as
beads in chains to hang about the neck. The
mound-builders of North America, the Indians
of the Mississippi Valley, of Virginia, of the
coasts of Florida, of the lands around the Gulf
of Mexico and everywhere in New Spain, all
wore them so. Egyptians, Persians, Arabians,
Hindus, Singhalese and South Sea islanders,
many of them without knowledge of countries
or peoples beyond their own or very near territory,
alike adopted this fashion. And it has
been followed by every newer people, as they
acquired by trade or the sword, the pearls with
which to so adorn themselves.</p>

<p>In lands of tropic heat the women wound
these strings of pearls about their arms, wrists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>and ankles also. Nor was the fashion confined
to women. When the Spaniards first reached
these shores, the caciques of Florida and the
incas of Peru, on occasions of State, wore ropes
of pearls around their necks, and so to this day
do the rajahs and princes of India and the
eastern islands. The more civilized peoples
used round pearls, and became more critical
about the quality and perfection of the gems
as they grew in wealth and refinement.</p>

<p>The necklaces found in the Indian mounds
are made principally of baroques, some of them
rounded, but many of them long, slender pieces,
bored a short distance from the thinner end,
so that they hung in pendant festoons. As
with all primitive races, the magnificence of
size appealed to the Indians of this hemisphere,
as it did also to the Spanish adventurers who
first landed on the coasts of America. A chronicler
of events during the time when De Soto
was governor of the province which now forms
several of the Southern States, mentions that
a cacique brought as a present to the governor
at the town of Ichiaha, a string of pearls as
large as filberts, five feet long.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>It is noticeable, that in all the accounts given
of the wealth of pearls discovered in the possession
of the natives, the Spaniards rarely say
anything about the shape or quality of the
pearls seen or taken, but always mention the
size when large. They do, however, constantly
deplore the discoloration caused by the use of
fire in the process of boring them. One may
imagine the chagrin of these freebooters on
finding heaps of royal gems wrecked by the
ignorance of the plundered; the value burned
out of them, like bank notes for millions mutilated
beyond redemption. The pearls composing
this five-foot string were all discolored,â€”good
enough for Indians, but of little value in
Spain and Europe.</p>

<p>Round baroques are strung for necklaces to
this day, especially in Italy, where the peasantry
save from their small earnings the equivalent of
two to three hundred dollars, to them an
enormous sum, to buy the coveted necklace of
pearls. These necklaces are composed usually
of several strands of small rounded baroques
weighing about one to two grains each and connected
by bars. Usually there are three to five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>strands, but some are made with as many as
eleven or twelve. Necklaces are made also in
the same way, of small round pearls, and the
bars, of which there are generally four, including
that containing the clasp, are studded with
diamonds.</p>

<p>The Asiatics prefer strings of large pearls,
graduating in size on either side from a large
central one. A number of these of increasing
length and fastened together at the clasp are
worn by Oriental royalties, so that each string
festoons below the preceding one, the lowest
and longest string sometimes hanging to the
waist. There are few however even among the
Hindu princes whose store of large pearls is
equal to such prodigality.</p>

<p>When pearl necklaces were adopted by the
Romans after their conquests in Egypt, Persia
and India, they vied with the monarchs they
had conquered, some of their rulers acquiring
pearls of enormous value. The wife of Caligula
owned pearls worth two million dollars, but
Oriental treasure-houses held greater accumulations.
The pearls of the late Rana of Dholpur
in Upper India, were valued at seven and a half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>million dollars. From Rome the fashion spread
with the advance of civilization through all the
nations of Europe and followed their colonizations
westward. Only in the last decade has
the use of pearls in the United States become
sufficiently general to place them in the list of
things that are a fashion.</p>

<p>Many large pearls of pear, egg, or drop shape,
and some round, are used as pendants, to be
hung on slender gold neck chains, or suspended
from brooches of diamonds. They are bored
at the smaller end to a depth of about one-eighth
of an inch, the hole is filled with a composition
which hardens rapidly, and in this a
gold wire, looped at one end for connecting, is
inserted. Formerly the pearl was drilled quite
through and the suspending wire riveted, but
this is rarely done now as it lessens the value
of the pearl and destroys the perfect pendant
effect. This is a European fashion. The
Chinese mount pearls by boring into the body
of the pearl at two, three or four points and
inserting the bent ends of spreading wires so
that the gem is clasped as by spreading finger
tips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p>Pear-shaped pearls were used in Rome for
pendant purposes as now and were known as
"elenchi." After the Roman fashion of "crotalia"
or "castanet" eardrops had passed, drop
pearls continued in more or less favor throughout
succeeding centuries as eardrops, the matching
of one nearly doubling the value of both.
Of late, egg and pear-shaped pearls have been
used largely as heads for scarf pins. They are
drilled and set on a gold wire or "pegged" as
it is called, in the manner described for pendants
but with the smaller end resting upon a light
gold ring soldered to the scarf pin, or in a small
cup, so that the pressure, while inserting the
pin, is distributed over the body of the pearl
and upon the end, instead of upon the inner wall
in contact with the end of the pin.</p>

<p>The Persians used pearls largely in the
jewelling of royal headgear, for Pompey is said
to have brought home twenty crowns of pearls
with the loot from his eastern raid. Hindu
princes strung them on straight wires of equal
length and bound a number of them together,
to be fastened as pompons or aigrettes, to their
turbans. They encrusted and edged their robes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>with them as also did the royalties and nobles
of Europe during the middle ages. Seed pearls
were strung in lengths of four to six feet and
the strands twisted together like a rope. This
fashion continues to this day, such ropes of
pearls sometimes measuring five feet in length.</p>

<p>The semi-barbarous Indian tribes of America
did not confine the use of pearls altogether to
personal adornment. They decorated their
idols, state canoes, the handles of the paddles,
and the figures in their temples with them, and
they buried enormous quantities in the sepulchres
with their dead. There is no evidence that
this latter form of extravagance was at any
time general in Asia or Europe, but Julius
CÃ¦sar made a buckler of British pearls which
he hung up in the temple of Venus Genetrix
after dedicating it to her.</p>

<p>Among the ancients it does not appear that
pearls were used in connection with the precious
metals to a great extent. Collars of gold and
silver with large pearls as pendants were sometimes
seen upon the necks of Indians by the
Spaniards when they landed on this continent,
but in Asia, Africa, and upon their first introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
into Europe, pearls were not used with
the metals as freely as other gems. As the art
of the jeweller developed however, they came
into more general use and are now utilized with
gold in every form of jewelry. Round and
button pearls with diamonds or other stones,
or alone, are set in gold as brooches, ear-rings,
finger-rings, bracelets, hair-ornaments, scarf-pins,
dress-pins, studs, cuff and dress buttons,
etc., and baroques are also used for the same
purposes. Brooches, lockets and pendants are
paved with solid masses of half pearls.</p>

<p>Some ancient swords of Hindu warriors
betray a curious custom. A groove with over-lapping
edges was sunk in the blade and into
this pearls were introduced from the hilt end
to represent the tears of enemies. There are
blades so constructed in the collection of Indian
swords presented to King Edward of England
when, as the Prince of Wales, he visited India.</p>

<p>Jewellers frequently avail themselves of the
odd shapes in which baroques occur to construct
unique jewels. Nature frequently gives them
a resemblance to animals, and sometimes to the
human figure and face, which may be accentuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
by the jeweller's art so as to make the
resemblance striking. In one notable instance
lately, a baroque was so mounted that it might
easily pass as a modelled portrait of Queen
Victoria. Baroques resembling bird's wings are
common and are often made effective by mounting
them on a bird of gold. Others remind one
of fish, birds, insects, and beasts of various
kinds. Clustered pearls enveloped together
sometimes look like dog's heads, in which two
of the enveloped pearls near the surface pass
for eyes. Long, slender baroques are set to
resemble the petals of a chrysanthemum, and
others, mounted singly in sepals of gold, are
suggestive of the buds of various flowers, roses,
lilies, etc.</p>

<p>Round and button pearls are used extensively
now, and have been at various periods
formerly, as centres for circles, or "clusters" of
diamonds mounted as scarf-pins, finger-rings
and formerly, when they were worn, as ear-rings.
The pearls are sometimes drilled and set on a
peg; sometimes they are held by claws or
prongs as the diamonds surrounding them are.</p>

<p>Pearls are very generally used now as studs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>by men for evening dress, usually mounted on
pegs so as to avoid the display of any gold.</p>

<p>But all fashions of wearing pearls except as
necklaces, are ephemeral. The fashion of pearl
necklaces has been constant for thousands of
years, though it is only brought to general
public notice when some new country with its
great and rapid accretions of wealth, adopts it.
The markets of the world are then affected, the
price of the gem rises, and this in turn tempts
ancient and impoverished families to unlock
their jewel cases to the bidding of the nouveau
riche. That this condition has existed from the
beginning of this century is shown by the sales
which are being made constantly in Europe at
the great public auctions of jewels. In 1901 the
Comtesse de Castiglione necklace was sold for
$84,000. At the sale of the Princess Mathilde
jewels in Paris, a three strand necklace of 133
pearls weighing 3320 grains, once the property
of Queen Sophie of Holland, brought 885,000
francs, which with the taxes to the purchaser
made the cost $188,000. At the same sale, a
seven strand collar given by Napoleon <abbr title="1">I</abbr>. to
the Queen of Westphalia, weighing 4,200 grs.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>brought $89,000, and another collar once owned
by the same Queen containing thirty-three
black pearls, weighing 1040 grs. was sold for
$20,240. Several fine strings were sold in
London in 1903. Among them a three-row
necklace from the Aquila Jewels for $22,400. A
string of 198 finely matched gem pearls, round
and graduated, was sold at Christie's for 6,500
pounds. A triple row of 153 of the same kind
brought 6,500 pounds. Many important sales
have been made in the States, during the last
ten years especially, but as they were made
privately, and as buyers here are averse to any
publicity they are not chronicled. It is a fact
well known to jewellers, that Americans in their
home market are extremely difficult. They
demand a degree of perfection, not only in the
gems themselves, but also in the matching of
them, rarely exacted in other countries. There
are strings of pearls in this country which if
less magnificent, for extreme perfection and
beauty are seldom equalled by the more notorious
jewels of Europe, and princely sums have
been paid for single pieces of great size and
purity. Greater quantities of the coveted treasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of the earth are pouring into the lap of
the United States of America through the channels
of peaceful industry, than were ever
gathered to a nation in the olden times by the
marauders of the sword, and the jewel cases of
our princes of commerce will soon eclipse those
held by the scions of ancient freebooters.</p>

<h2>VARIETIES </h2>


<p>True pearls are divided primarily into two
classes, "oriental," and "fresh-water." By true
pearls those creations are meant which consist
of concentric layers of nacre or mother-of-pearl,
as distinguished from similar formations by
mollusks out of material that is not pearly.</p>

<p>In the early days pearls brought from the
Orient were therefore called "Oriental" pearls.
For the same reason the fine mellow luster
which characterized and made them superior
to others came to be known as the "orient" of
the pearl. These pearls were taken from oysters
found on the coasts of Ceylon, Arabia, and the
Red Sea. Later, when the same kind of oysters
containing similar pearls were found in other
seas, they were also classified with them, until
the term "oriental" is now applied usually to all
true pearls taken from salt water mollusks, to
distinguish them from those found in the fresh
water mussels and other products of ocean shell-fish
which, though similar in construction and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>composition, are not nacreous. Occasionally,
however, the term is still applied specifically to
pearls from the Indian Seas, though their
"orient" or luster is not always finer than that
of like pearls found in many other localities.</p>

<p>Pearl oysters are varieties of the Avicula
Margaritifera, of which the Meleagrina Margaritifera
is the most prolific of mother-of-pearl and
pearls combined, and, the Indian excepted,
yields the finest pearls. All pearl oysters do
not produce sufficient mother-of-pearl to make
their shells valuable, nor do they all contain
pearls. The name therefore applies to all
oysters whose secretions are productive, in some
degree, of mother-of-pearl and therefore under
favorable conditions of pearls also.</p>

<p>"Fresh-water" or "sweet-water" pearls are,
as the name signifies, those found in the mollusks
of inland waters. This mollusk is a
mussel. The name "mussel" in Anglo-Saxon
signifies something which retires on being
touched. It is known as "Unio" of which there
are many pearl-bearing varieties.</p>

<p>In both the sea oyster and the fresh-water
mussel, other nacreous formations occur of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>irregular shape called "baroque" pearls. The
orientals approach more nearly to the globular
and hemispherical form of true pearls, having
frequently the lumpy rotundity of a snowball
and sometimes sections which are smooth and
round. The fresh-water baroques are usually
very irregular, often fantastically so. Many
resemble the incisor teeth of man or distorted
grains of corn. Slender pieces similar to the
wing of a bird and therefore called "wing"
pearls, or "hinge" pearls because they are
found near the hinge of the shell, are common.
Some are shaped like a flat spike nail. Unlike
oriental baroques, the surface of a large proportion
of the fresh-waters is grooved or indented
and some show a beautiful iridescence. Large
button baroques of fine luster and iridescent,
especially when they have a decided tinge of
pink, have come to be known of late as "rose"
pearls. Another variety of pink baroques having
a fairly regular shape with a lustrous and
finely irregular pimply surface are known as
"strawberry" pearls. These terms are applied
indiscriminately to the two varieties however.</p>

<p>Another nacreous formation found in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>mother-of-pearl oyster shells is the "blister."
It is produced by the raising of the nacreous
deposits above the level of the shell to cover
some intruder of considerable size. This results
in a growth similar in shape to a blister on the
flesh, hence the name. It is cut out of the shell
and used in various ways as a set for jewelry,
or to imitate the bodies of insects or small animals.
Others with a slightly higher dome and
rounded oval shape, regular in form, are called
"turtlebacks."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">PANAMA PEARL-SHELL, SHOWING MUD-BLISTERS, BORERS, AND PEARL</p>
</div>

<p>Some of these hollow shells of pearl have been
found to cover small fish, lizards, etc. The
writer saw one which appeared to be a large
button-pearl. On lifting, it proved to be a shell
of several thicknesses of nacre covering a small
shell-fish about a half-inch in diameter. The
imprisoned mollusk was shrunken and crumbling
so that the nacreous covering could be
lifted from over it, a hollow dome of pearl.
Mud blisters are common in some waters and
depreciate the quality of the shell and are otherwise
useless. A typical mud-blister appears in
the shell illustrated herewith.</p>

<p>The Abalone pearl occurs usually as a baroque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>or blister but occasionally it is found solid and
spherical. Although it is not classed among
true pearls, a few globular pieces found are
entitled to a place among them because they
are sometimes identical in construction and have
a similar pearly luster, it is however very liable
to crack and break and can seldom be pierced
with safety.</p>

<p>The shell-fish from which it takes the name is
the Haliotis, called here the Abalone. It is
known under many namesâ€”ear-shell, Venus's
ear, etc. In the English Channel Islands it is
the ormer, and on the adjacent coast of France
where it is very abundant the name for it is
similarâ€” "ormier." The Aelonians called it the
"Ear of Venus." The shell is ear-shaped,
flattened, slightly spiral and has a series of
round holes near the edge curving with the last
whorl toward the boss. As it grows, the oldest
of these are successively filled up and the last
remaining open, serves as the anal channel.
The exterior is very rough and unsightly, but
the mother-of-pearl interior is one of the most
exquisite pieces of color work painted by the
hand of nature and to this is added an enlivening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
iridescence most fascinating. Like it, the
pearl formations are deeply tinted. Brownish
reds, peacock greens, and dark grays are the
prevailing colors. They are seldom of even
color or luster, many of them having but one
lustrous point where a pearly glaze seems to
have been incorporated with the earthenware
like surface.</p>

<p>Usually the pearls when round and lustrous
are not constructed as compactly as those of
the bivalves. The texture of the skins vary in
quality and the frequent presence of intermediary
strata of black conchiolin which
shrink, makes them liable to crack and break.
The blisters run very even in these two qualities
of color and luster and though seldom quite as
brilliant as the nacre of the shell, are very
beautiful and often curiously formed. These
blister-baroques are like two blisters joined at
the edges, and are liable to separate there.
The interior consists chiefly of black conchiolin,
rough and somewhat shiny.</p>

<p>The "Conch" pearl, found in the Conch
(Strombus gigas) of the West Indies, also is not
a true pearl. The shell is used largely for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>ornamental purposes, especially for the cutting
of cameos, and also in porcelain works. It is a
large shell, sometimes weighing four or five
pounds. Formerly great quantities were exported
to England from the Bahamas; in
one year as many as three hundred thousand.
Conch pearls are devoid of nacreous luster, the
surface having an appearance like china. They
are slightly transparent and show under the
surface a series of delicate wavy markings.</p>

<p>The silky sheen of these lines causes them to
appear lighter than the body color of the pearl,
and they seem to branch toward the surface,
changing kaleidoscopically as the pearl is turned.
Almost without exception the shape is ovoid,
or a flattened ovoid, though some are distorted.
In color they range from very pale to deep pink
and coral red, the ends being usually much
lighter than the body and often white. In the
deeper tints they are more uniform in color,
and as they are apt to be less lustrous and transparent
as the shade deepens to red they show
less plainly the distinguishing wavy lines, and
may be easily mistaken for pieces of coral cut
to the shape and polished. They are very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>delicate and therefore easily fractured or
cracked. As the natives usually obtain the
pearls by cooking the fish, for which they have
a great liking, a large proportion of the few
which come into the market are cracked. It
is claimed also that the color fades with time.
They are sometimes called "Nassau" pearls.</p>

<p>Pearls similar in appearance to the Conch,
except that the wavy lines are absent and the
skin rarely as brilliant, are taken with true
pearls from the small varieties of the Avicula,
especially about the coast of Venezuela. Some
are white as chalk, many are tinted in various
shades of gray, yellow and brownish reds. They
have the shining appearance of china in different
degrees, but no nacreous luster. The skins of
many of these are peculiarly constructed, they
show modified characteristics of various parts
of the shell. The surface wave lines are present
to some extent, together with curious malformations
of prisms and conchiolin.</p>

<p>The hexagonal faces look as though they had
been doubled up upon themselves together with
a layer of conchiolin, the latter appearing as
thick black V or U shaped marks in the faces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>of the distorted hexagons. Heretofore these
have been considered valueless, but it is possible
that with the increasing vogue of pearls
and the growing desire for oddities, they will
be utilized in the cheaper forms of jewelry.</p>

<p>Creations similar in construction to pearls
are found occasionally in the common oyster
and clam. Though entirely devoid of the pearly
texture and luster, some of them are very
perfect in shape and smoothness of skin.
Whether taken from the oyster or clam they
are usually called "clam pearls." The color of
the oyster pearl is generally a light drab. The
clam pearls are mostly purplish red or blue,
often dark enough to appear black. Those
taken from the oyster are generally round;
those from the clam are more frequently ovoid.
Occasionally one or both ends of the oval are
lighter in color, as the Conch pearl is, changing
there to a dark red or purple. When the color
is very dark and the skin uncommonly good,
they have been sold for black pearls by unscrupulous
dealers. They are accounted of little
value, though exceptionally large pieces will
sometimes sell for as much as one hundred to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>hundred and fifty dollars. Similar to these,
pearly formations characterized by a glazed, or
glassy, or shiny surface, are found in many
molluscan varieties, bivalves and univalves,
but none of these are true pearls.</p>

<p>Pearls similar to the pink Conch are found in
the shank or chank of Ceylon (Turbinella
scolymus). This is the sacred shell of the
Hindus and the national emblem of Travancore
in the Madras presidency, India. Vishnu carries
a chank called "Devadatta" in his hand.
It is said his first incarnation was for the purpose
of destroying ShankhÃ¡sura (the giant chank
shell), and thereby regaining the Vedas, which
had been stolen and taken to ocean deeps.</p>

<p>The ideal color for a pearl is white. Although
all fine white pearls show by comparison a tint
of some color, a fine white must be free from an
appearance which can only be described as
"dark." It is not color always but a certain
density which makes the gem appear dead by
comparison with the soft, warm, life-like white
of the perfect pearl. The layers or skins of
some pearls are more transparent than others
and this imparts a liveliness which is absent in
the more dense.</p>

<p>Upon looking at a string of pearls held
between the eye and the light, some will appear
much lighter than others and show a translucent
band about one-fifth the diameter of the pearl,
extending from the edge of the circumference
inward. Such pearls upon examination will
be found much finer in color and texture than
those which have the appearance beside them
of dark opaque spots when held against the
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<p>There is also a white which is not dark and is
yet dead. To some extent it is characteristic
of all fresh-water pearls. It is a chalky, milky
white that even when lustrous, carries a reminder
of chalk in the texture and lacks the
essential life of the ideal pearl. Color in the
highest perfection is found in the pearls of the
Ceylon and Australian waters, the former being
also very lustrous, and such are sometimes
termed by the trade "Madras," after the city
where the Indian pearls have been marketed for
ages. It must not be inferred however that
pearls equally good are not found in other
localities, but that the color averages better,
and the number of gems of ideal color and luster
is greater from the Ceylon fisheries than elsewhere.
The color and texture, and therefore
luster, of fine Indian pearls is seldom equalled,
never surpassed.</p>

<p>To those who are without experience, and see
for the first time a large quantity of pearls
apparently alike in color, it would seem an easy
matter to match any required number; but in
attempting to gather sufficient for a single
strand necklace, one would learn that a parcel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>or series of pearls, seemingly all white, contains
a surprisingly great variety of shades or tones
of color; that which appears at first sight quite
easy becomes in the attempt extremely difficult.
Probably nothing requires a sharper eye,
a more delicate sense of color and greater
patience, than the assembling of a finely matched
string of pearls. Bearing in mind that size,
shape, color, and perfection, must all correspond,
it is not surprising that few strings exist
which are above criticism.</p>

<p>Those who buy them seldom realize what
enormous quantities of pearls, and skilful and
painstaking effort is necessary, to match perfectly,
thirty or more, especially of large size.
Pearls which, separated by a few inches seem
alike, when brought close together reveal differences
of texture and tone of color sufficiently
pronounced to arrest the eye and
destroy that ideal perfection of purity which
permits no spot to mar the symmetry of an
assemblage of these emblematic gems. It was
said in old times that to match a pearl perfectly
was to double the value of both; one may
imagine therefore the difficulty which confronts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>the modern jeweller when he undertakes in this
critical age to match thirty or forty.</p>

<p>The color most common in pearls of all seas
is yellow, but it is not so with fresh-water ones.
Other colors are seldom found except as tints
in white pearls, but distinctly yellow oriental
pearls are abundant. The tones of color in
the white are, yellow, blue, pink and green.
They are so slight that it is difficult to recognize
them except by comparison. The blue and
pink are considered best, the champions of each
being about equal. The green come next in
favor and the yellow last. This order applies
fully however to the Occident only. Some
Oriental peoples do not draw such fine distinctions,
and the Chinese prefer the creamy yellow
to any other.</p>

<p>The "blue" pearls, or "Panama" pearls as
they are sometimes called in the trade, must
not be confounded with the blue white pearls
just mentioned. "Blue" pearls are of a dingy,
slaty blue tint. They have a dark appearance
and the luster is seldom good. As many of this
character are found in the Panama waters such
pearls are often sold as "Panama" pearls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>They are even less desirable than those which
are decidedly yellow, though persons of a little
knowledge will often buy them in preference to
others which are better, because they are not
yellow and are cheap.</p>

<p>"Fancies" include all decided colors, or those
having a rare and beautiful tint. Yellow pearls
as generally found are not classed among them
because the color is not fine, but dark,â€” "brackish"
one might term it. A clean buttercup
yellow, or an orange yellow, would be
"fancy" however. On the other hand a deep
pink is seldom fine as the color is then almost
invariably muddy, whereas the clean delicate
light pink pearls are rare and highly esteemed.
A clear grass green is never seen but the color
occurs in very beautiful bronze and peacock
shadings. Various shades of blue, rose, copper,
and red with bronze effects, and black are
included in this classification.</p>

<p>Black pearls are much prized, and the term
covers a wide range of dark shades of gray,
slate, brown and red. The ideal color however
is sufficiently deep to be, as the name
indicates, black, though it has not the metallic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>appearance of hematite, nor the polished shine
of the black clam pearl. Black pearls having
a bronze effect are open to suspicion, especially
if they are pierced, as many of them are artificially
colored and are liable to fade. Such
pearls have a somewhat metallic appearance,
are seldom very lustrous, and if there is a
rough chalky place in the skin it will be
blacker there than elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give rules by which to judge
color, but there is a quality which can only be
described as "clean." It is free from muddiness
and is desirable in pearls as in all other gems.</p>

<p>The proportion of fancy colors is greater in
fresh-water pearls than in the orientals. In the
United States the fisheries which have yielded
the finest "fancies" are those of Wisconsin,
Kentucky and Tennessee. Of sea pearls, most
of the fine black ones come from the coasts of
Mexico. Beautiful colored pearls are found in
fisheries of the Oceanic Islands, for instance at
the Isles of New Caledonia and Gambier, and
in China and Japan.</p>

<p>To make close comparisons of color in pearls,
place them on white cotton under or opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>a strong natural light. To judge shape and
luster, roll them on black cloth. These are
the most trying conditions and it should be
remembered by those who test them thus, that
no position as jewels when worn can be so
unfavorable or trying.</p>

<h2>IMPERFECTIONS </h2>


<p>Few pearls are perfect. The great majority
of small pearls even, fail in one or more of the
ideal qualities, and as the size increases perfection
becomes more rare. A perfect pearl is
not necessarily of the finest luster, but it must
be lustrous and of even luster all over. If
round, it must be spherically round; if pear or
ovoid, symmetrically so, and the skin must be
free from blemishes.</p>

<p>Baroque and button pearls are naturally
imperfect pearls, the former being fantastically
irregular in shape and the latter partially
deformed. Imperfections of shape in what are
termed round pearls are more numerous than
those unaccustomed to handling them would
suppose.</p>

<p>A lot of pearls which to the casual glance
seem to be all quite round, will be found often
on close examination to contain many, if not a
majority, that are not. Upon rolling them
separately, irregularities will appear which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>luster and contiguity of others concealed. It
will be discovered that the domes of some are
slightly flattened at one part of the sphere; in
others at two opposite points so as to form a
double domed disk. Very many have slight
protuberances above the contour of the sphere,
or places in the spherical line, which though
not flat, are depressed. While these minor
imperfections of shape do not materially hurt
the beauty of the pearl, they do decrease the
value somewhat, and as they are quite common
even among fine selected pearls they accentuate
the rarity of the perfectly spherical.</p>

<p>The adventures of a pearl from the moment
when the mollusk begins to cover its nucleus
with nacre, until the fisher squeezes it from the
folds of the creature's mantle, are many and
varied. A few only escape untoward happenings.
The fortunate, born where the mollusk
gathers and spreads its choice secretions of
mother-of-pearl, with room to grow on every
side, are nursed in the lap of good fortune and
uncheckered, round out layer by layer to perfection.</p>

<p>But some are not so fortunate. In some way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>cramped, they are held against the unyielding
shell and grow flat on one side. These are the
button pearls. Others either from an irregular
rolling, or unequal action of the mollusk's
mantle, become imperfectly round. Sometimes
foreign particles attach themselves to a growing
pearl and becoming enveloped with it in
future layers, make an uneven surface.</p>

<p>Not infrequently two round pearls grow side
by side until they touch, and together are
enveloped by succeeding deposits; a twinned
pearl is the result. For some reason, drop and
pear-shaped pearls are seldom imperfect in shape.
They may not be ideal but the form is usually
good and the contour even and regular. This
would imply that the simple rolling motion by
the fish is more regular than the more complicated
movements necessary to form a sphere.</p>

<p>Imperfections in the texture and luster of
the skin are said to be due to the movement of
the growing pearl among the zones of the
mollusk's mantle supplying the varied material
for the epidermis, middle shell, and lining. The
difficulties confronting this theory are explained
in the chapter on the "Genesis of Pearls."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>These imperfections consist generally of dead
white chalky spots and streaks, distributed over
the surface of the pearl, oftentimes so small as
to escape notice except under the loup. Sometimes
these imperfections take the form of rings
or bands which encircle the pearl. Pearls so
marked are rarely if ever round, but ovoid,
capsule, or cartridge shaped, and these chalky
lines always encircle the cylinder; they never
cross the dome. Rings around the dome occur,
but the surface over them is of equal luster.
Frequently the entire outer skin is without
luster. Whether this arises from lack of some
element in the exudations of the mollusk from
which the pearl is created, or from an imperfect
crystallization of the calcium carbonate, is not
known. Such skins have the usual nacreous
surface wave lines and are often lustrous
immediately under the outer plates of the skin.</p>

<p>It is possible that these chalky skins may
result from the extraction of the pearl from the
mollusk during a transitional stage, and that the
presence of spots and streaks of that character,
scattered over an otherwise lustrous surface,
indicates that the secretions of the creature's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>mantle did not hold some essential ingredient
in sufficient quantity to secure perfect
crystallization and thereby cover the entire
surface with transparent plates of calcium carbonate.
It may be also that a lack of essential
elements in the creature's exudations, causes a
cessation of the mantle's action which by all
signs appears necessary for the production of
transparent plates of nacre.</p>

<p>"Peelers" are pearls of imperfect skins having
indications of a better one underneath.
Speculators buy these pearls at a low price and
skin them. Sometimes they are rewarded by
a smaller, but much more valuable pearl.
Many times the under skins are no better or
worse, or if better, the loss in size and weight,
together with the cost of the work, make it
unprofitable.</p>

<p>Peeling should not be attempted with cylindrical
shaped pearls having chalky bands or
rings around them, as such imperfections usually
penetrate to the interior in pearls of that
character. Cylindrical pearls are almost invariably
fresh-waters. The imperfections disclosed
in the under skins by peeling, are commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>irregularities of shape which have been rounded
over to the improvement of the sphericity of
the pearl.</p>

<p>It is currently reported among the pearl
hunters who fish the western and southern
streams, that the finding of soft pearls is not
infrequent. Upon opening the mussel, they
sometimes see through the mantle of the
creature, an apparently fine pearl which upon
being taken out proves to be a soft jelly-like
substance, the form of which is usually destroyed
in squeezing it out. These men do not believe
that a pearl is formed in layers, but think that
all pearls are originally globules of a similar
soft substance, hardening later to a compact
solid ball and they call them "mussel eggs."</p>

<p>Many pearls taken from the small thin-shelled
varieties of the ocean mollusk, as for
instance those of Venezuela, are devoid in part,
or wholly, of the nacreous luster and instead
have a china-like or waxy luster, or a dead
chalky skin. A large proportion of the Abalone
pearls and baroques are lustrous only in part,
one section having an earthenware appearance.
Many appear to be formed of interstratified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>layers of nacre and conchiolin. This construction
is very distinct in a formation peculiar to
the Abalone, consisting of two nacreous shells
joined perfectly at the edges, the inside walls
of both being covered with rough black conchiolin.</p>

<p>Peculiarities in the quality of the nacre
sometimes give an appearance of uneven shape
which does not exist in reality. The light falling
upon such pearls produces a knobby effect,
as though there were protuberances on the surface.
The texture of others is such that when
looked at squarely from the front they appear
pyramidal in form, the rounded apex pointing
toward the observer. Such pearls have a soft,
waxy appearance generally.</p>

<p>Another common imperfection consists of pits
in the surface. These may result from various
causes: in many cases from the dislodgement
and rolling of a pearl which has been flattened
during earlier stages by pressure in one position
against the shell. Freed from this hindrance
to spherical growth, the later concentric layers
would round over the edge of the flat spot and
thereby leave a pit, or cavity, in the centre.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<p>In other cases pressure against the pearl,
or the partial inclusion of foreign substances,
especially of an organic nature which decay
before being entirely covered, are possible
causes. The reverse of this also occurs; grains
of sand or other minute particles adhering to
the surface are covered by succeeding layers,
thereby producing knobs, more or less observable
according to the lapse of time between their
inclusion and the taking of the pearl from the
oyster.</p>

<p>If undisturbed, the fish will by the deposit
of sufficient layers of nacre, fill the intervals
and round the surface again. That this is
done in time is shown by the occurrence of
pearls having an even dome over a nucleus
formed by a cluster of small round and irregular
pearls enveloped together. In the process of
skinning, or the removal of one or more of the
layers of nacre, it is sometimes found that a
depression has been filled by a thickening of
the deposits in the hollow; at other times extra
layers fill the space, and these flaking out with
the outer skin reveal the hidden irregularity
which lay beneath the round surface, thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>necessitating the removal of several entire
skins before a sphere is reached again. The
under skins of some pearls appear to have failed
to completely envelop the nucleus. The cavity
resulting is then filled to an even surface and is
succeeded by fully developed skins. It is,
therefore, not certain that a pearl, perfect in
form and skin when found, has been so at all
stages of its growth. Broken pearls sometimes
show not only differences of color but of thickness
in the successive layers. The skins of
fresh-water pearls especially are often very
irregular in thickness.</p>

<p>Many pearls have cracks in them. These
generally escape the observation of inexpert
persons, as they are usually under the outer
layer. The fact that they rarely extend to the
surface suggests that the solidification, or drying
out of the confined interior layers, may be
the cause. These are considered detrimental
and dangerous by dealers, so that pearls with
cracks in them will not bring as high a price as
they would if free from them.</p>

<p>As cracked pearls are liable to break, especially
when pierced for stringing, it is well to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>avoid them, though the percentage of those
which do break is small. In reality these cracks
are more of an imperfection than a danger.
Occasionally they are quite noticeable and are
then a bad imperfection, but frequently a sharp
eye or the loup only will detect them. Surface
cracks however are quite perceptible. They
are dangerous and are considered a serious
imperfection.</p>

<p>There is a peculiarity of rare occurrence
which, as it is a departure from the ideal, may
be termed an imperfection, though some regard
it of value as unique. It is a similarity under
the surface of some pearls to a metal which
has been hammered into small flat spots identical
in appearance with the jewelry in vogue
during the latter part of the 19th century made
of "hammered gold." It is scarcely noticeable
except under a loup, when the fine lines dividing
the confused planes appear. These pearls are
usually slightly pink or pinkish yellow. Sometimes
these planes resemble the facets on a
cut diamond, generally lozenge shape, and
often grouped similar to those on the under
side of a diamond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>Small holes and blisters on the surface are
quite common, but ordinarily they are scarcely
perceptible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>Many faults can be concealed by the jeweller
when the pearl is mounted. Slightly buttoned
pearls are set on a peg in the centre of a small
shallow cup; they then appear quite round. A
spot, blister, or cavity, in a round pearl can
be obliterated by pegging, or hidden in the
setting. Great irregularities in the sphericity
are lost to the eye when the gem is set in the
prongs of a ring or other piece of jewelry.
Pearls shaped like a double convex lens may be
made to look round, or very nearly so, by piercing
them so that the flattened domes are brought
in contact on the cord holding them together
as a necklace.</p>

<p>Piercing and stringing obliterates or hides
many flaws. By careful selection, the jeweller
can utilize pearls having a blemish by drilling
through the spot where the flaw is, and if there
is another on the opposite side that also will
disappear. Other imperfections near the hole
are often hidden in necklaces, as they cannot
be seen when the pearls are held close together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>on the string. It is for this reason that a string
of pearls can often be bought for less than a
like number of loose pearls apparently no better
but which in reality are much more perfect
in shape and free from flaws. Imperfections
unseen in the strung pearls would be quite
noticeable in the loose and undrilled.</p>

<p>The irregularities of baroques cannot properly
be called imperfections; nevertheless a
baroque is more valuable as it is free from
indentations and approaches the round in
appearance, or has sides which will give it a
round face when mounted. The curious forms
into which nature moulds many of them are
very attractive, and as they lend themselves
to the imaginative skill of the jeweller, are
valuable. The faults common to them are
rough places uncovered by nacre and colored
streaks or spots, usually yellow tending to
brown. These discolorations are confined generally
to the point where the baroque was
attached to the shell, but not infrequently they
extend far enough to leave no front which
would be quite clean to the eye, when mounted.</p>

<p>Oriental baroques as a rule are more lustrous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>more even in shape and seldom discolored.
Many of them are sufficiently regular to string
for necklaces, and some can be used in jewelry
so that on the face they appear like round,
drop, or pear-shaped pearls.</p>

<h2>GENESIS OF PEARLS </h2>


<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_127" name="i_127"><img src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="" width="373" height="480" /></a>
<p class="caption">TUAMOTU PEARL-SHELL</p>
</div>

<p>Pearls are found in certain marine and fresh-water
mollusks. The former are usually termed
oysters, though zoÃ¶logists regard it in some
instances as a misnomer. The sea-fish is the
avicula margaritifera, a bivalve of which there
are many varieties, all of similar shape and
nature but differing widely in the size, weight,
coloring, and quality of the shell.</p>

<p>Of them, the genus "meleagrina" is the
largest, has the heaviest shell, and furnishes the
greatest quantity of the beautiful substance
known as mother-of-pearl. The other extreme
is the small, frail-shelled variety taken off the
coast of Venezuela, called sometimes avicula
squamulosa. Similar to this is the margaritifera
vulgaris, or avicula fucata, of Ceylon.
The pearl oyster of the Persian Gulf though
similar is somewhat larger.</p>

<p>Exact and uniform classification of the pearl-bearing
mollusks of the sea does not exist,
nor is it necessary in this connection, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>one distinctive feature which places them in
the class under consideration is the possession
of a nacreous lining to the shell, for no shell
fish can produce a true pearl without it. The
fresh-water pearl-bearing mollusk is a mussel,
unio margaritifera, also found in many varieties,
but all characterized alike by the nacreous
lining of the shell.</p>

<p>These creatures, living upon the earth where
water always covers it, create in the building
of their habitations a material of great beauty,
and sometimes produce gems which princes
covet. Of the most delicate nature, they build
for themselves out of the water by which they
are surrounded, houses strong and enduring,
fitted for their protection from the rough
chances of life, yet so furnished within that they
suffer no inconvenience from the rugged strength
which encloses them. Few things are coarser
than the exterior of these domiciles, but nothing
in nature is finer or more exquisitely beautiful
than the substance with which they are lined.</p>

<p>The avicula margaritifera is a habitant of the
coral reefs and shoals about the islands and
shores of the tropics; there are none living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>now in northern latitudes, though fossils of
many species are found north of the present
boundary of their habitations. An idea can be
formed of the general shape and appearance of
pearl-oyster shells by the neighboring illustrations
of three varieties. These show the
two extremes of the marine mollusk, the
meleagrina of the South Sea and Australia, and
the squamulosa of Venezuela.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_129" name="i_129"><img src="images/i_128.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="480" /></a>
<p class="caption">AUSTRALIAN PEARL-SHELL</p>
</div>

<p>In some of the small species, that of the
Venezuelan Coast for instance, the outer shell
is yellowish, with fan-like markings of dark
reddish brown radiating from the boss or beak
and growing darker as they near the lip. This
shell is thin and frail. The nacreous lining is
also thin but brilliantly iridescent and shows a
series of fine lines and irregular fissure-like
markings extending outward from the hinge
and crossed by bands of color which curve with
the outline of the lip edge of the shell.</p>

<p>These colors, as brilliant but more evasive
than the hues of the rainbow, are not due to
the presence of a pigment; they arise from a
phenomenon of light and form one of the most
wonderful illustrations of the ease with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>our senses play tricks upon judgment and
understanding. It is the striated surface and
the very thin transparent plates of nacre, which
cause a double interference and produce the
beautiful iridescence peculiar to the lining of
these shells.</p>

<p>"Interference," as it is called, is an optical
phenomenon arising from two causes. When
light falls upon a sufficiently thin transparent
surface covering a denser substratum not
exactly parallel with it, part of the light is at
once reflected. Of that which passes through
to the under surface a part also is in turn reflected
through the first surface, and the confusion
of rays or "interference" resulting, produces
to the eye the sensation of color.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_131" name="i_131"><img src="images/i_130.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="480" /></a>
<p class="caption">VENEZUELAN PEARL-SHELL, WITH PEARL ATTACHED</p>
</div>

<p>A familiar illustration is seen when a thin
film of oil is spread over water. The other way
in which iridescence by interference is produced
in shells, may be demonstrated by drawing
fine lines close together on glass with a
diamond. Light falling upon them will make
the surface iridescent. Melted wax dropped
upon this striated surface would, upon removal,
show a like iridescence, reproduced with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>impression of the fine lines. The outer markings
of the large Australian shell are similar to the
small Venezuelan. The mother-of-pearl interior
is not so iridescent.</p>

<p>Pearls and the shells in which they grow are
composed almost entirely of calcium carbonate
or lime. A small percentage of organic matter
and water are the other ingredients.</p>

<p>As pearls are accidental and the result of a
misdirection of normal processes, a general
knowledge of those processes is necessary to an
insight into the nature and genesis of the pearl,
and as pearl shells and the pearls in them are
constructed on the same general plan, a knowledge
of the former will assist to a better understanding
of the gem and its eccentricities. The
mother-of-pearl shell is built up of a series of
calcium carbonate plates or prisms set in organic
matter. In the material of the inner shell, the
calcium carbonate greatly preponderates; on
the outside of the shell, the organic matter is
largely in excess. In the building of its shell,
the animal deposits the finest material and does
the best and most compact work where the
house is in touch with itself, the walls becoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>coarser in construction and quality as they
approach the outer surface.</p>

<p>In the inside of the shell, the calcium carbonate
plates are very fine and transparent,
and the animal membrane in which they are set
is of extreme tenuity. In the middle shell these
plates become more chalky and less compact; in
the exterior shell they are set in a thicker binding
of organic matter and terminate outside in rough,
horny fringes, completely covering the shell.</p>

<p>In a general way therefore, the animal
deposits the best of its secretions about itself
and pushes out to the outer extremities, the
coarser elements which are fitted to preserve
the finer parts of the shell, as the finer parts of
the shell are fitted to protect the delicate organism
which they enclose. The building of the
shell is done by a membraneous covering of the
fish which entirely envelops the body and is
attached to the shell a short distance from the
inner edge, leaving a rim of membrane free
around the fish and the edges of the two valves.
This membrane is called the mantle. It
extracts lime from the water, and at different
parts exudes modified solutions of it mixed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>animal tissue, suitable for the construction of
the various parts of the shell.</p>

<p>The exterior of the shell or epidermis consists
of conchiolin, an organic compound. It is a
horny-looking substance, and in the large salt-water
shells and in most of the fresh-water
mussels, the nigger-head of the Mississippi
Valley especially, it appears to the eye as a
series of extensions, sometimes terminating in
ridges, which curve about the umbo and spread
to the edge of the shell, each extension coming
from under the one preceding. In some varieties
it is attached as an excrescence to the
prismatic formation immediately under it, and
may be easily detached in thin flakes: a rusty
black in some, brownish-yellow in all on the
inner surface and in some on the outside. The
substance is generally opaque, but contains
spots of which some are translucent, resembling
horn or amber, while others are more transparent,
similar in formation to the inner parts
of the shell.</p>

<p>In most of the marine and fresh-water varieties,
unlike the nigger-head, the conchiolin
exterior does not easily flake off. In these the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>outer shell is composed of wave-like plate extensions,
superimposed one upon the other recedingly
from the lip to the umbo as in the others,
but without the ridges, the plates being flat
and the edges more irregular. These extensions
are formed of a number of horizontal composite
plates, which penetrate the shell to the mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>Not only may they be separated into thinner
horizontal plates, but they divide vertically
into prisms. Under the microscope the edge of
a composite plate appears as a number of prisms
placed side by side lengthwise across the plate
edge, but showing dark, intersecting lines
through the series where they divide as plates.</p>

<p>These prisms appear on the face of the plates
as translucent hexagons, separated by dark
lines like a tessellated floor, and under a powerful
microscope are seen to be composed of similar
smaller particles, also joined together by a
binder of tissue. The exposed parts of the
epidermis plates, forming the outer skin of the
shell, are more dense than the unexposed portions;
the hexagonal dividing lines are thick and
blurred, and the faces are almost opaque,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>whereas in the unexposed parts, the faces are
translucent and the hexagonal markings are
clear and fine.</p>

<p>Though constructed in the same way throughout,
these plates appear to follow the general
plan of shell construction, the preponderance of
calcium carbonate in the interior parts gradually
changing to an excess of organic matter as
they become exposed to form the outer part of
the shell. The outer shell is in some varieties
of a brownish-yellow with radiating fan-like
markings of a deeper tint or red; in others, dark
gray and brown to almost black. Immediately
under the surface, the plates become lighter in
color, and finally almost white as they approach
the nacreous interior.</p>

<p>In all varieties the outer plates lie almost
parallel with the extension of the shell, so that,
lapping each other as they do, the outer contour
of the shell is raised by a series of low steps from
the edge to the umbo. These plates appear to
have been superimposed one upon the other.
On the contrary, they are added on the under
side. Starting from the umbo, which is the
oldest part, the shell is enlarged by the addition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>of a succession of plates from beneath, each
series extending a little beyond its predecessor,
the rough conchiolin fringe at their extremities
forming the outer covering of the shell. Following
the growth of the epidermis, the shell and
the lining are also extended and built up, so
that the entire shell is constantly pushed to
dimensions necessary for the proper and commodious
housing of its growing tenant.</p>

<p>Under the thin coat of epidermis on the Unio
nigger-head, is a stratum of prism plates similar
to the outer plates of the Venezuelan oyster.
The prism faces are however smaller and the
organic intersections are thicker and darker.
Immediately under and abutting, is another
series of plates which penetrate the shell
almost horizontally at the lip end, to the lining;
diagonally at the thick part of the shell near
the umbo to another series of the same kind.
Here, owing to their diagonal set, upon peeling
off the epidermis and the epidermis plates, the
edges appear as a series of fine lines curving
about and spreading out from the umbo. The
plates set outward, away from the umbo, from
the lower or inner edge.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<p>The effect is similar to that made by a pack
of cards set diagonally so as to spread the edges
sufficiently to show the merest trifle of the faces
of the cards between the edges. The arrangement
of these plates, not only produces a series
of fine lines curving about the umbo, but, as
the edges are slightly irregular, another series
of fine lines cross the others at right angles,
radiating from the umbo. This doubly striated
surface, by interference, produces an iridescence
more full of color than the mother-of-pearl of
any but the thin-shelled varieties.</p>

<p>Though similar in construction, these plates
differ from those of the epidermis. In some
respects they suggest a transitional stage
between the outer and inner shell. A plate, as
it separates from the series and which appears
as one line in the striated surface of plate edges,
is in reality a number of very thin plates, or
waves, so welded together that they cannot
easily be separated. In this and the presence
of fine surface lines marking the wave edges,
they resemble the nacreous plates.</p>

<p>The composite plate is opaque, but when
split so that light can penetrate there appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>on the face, markings similar to the unexposed
portions of the Venezuelan epidermis plates only
the hexagonal faces are very much smaller and
less distinct. So also the edge of the composite
plate appears as series of prisms crossing it from
face to face on the plate, in sets which show
plainly, lines marking the juncture of the
individual plates or waves. Although the
individual plates or waves, can only be separated
with great difficulty, together, as composite
plates, they can be flaked off from the
shell very easily, and they crumble and break
into fragments under slight pressure. The
component plates or waves are very thin, and
appear under the microscope as white and
translucent planes marked by outlines of the
prism faces.</p>

<p>The inner series of these plates as they near
the nacreous lining become harder and more
compact, and incline more and more to a
horizontal position, so that at the point where
they abut upon the nacre it is not easy to distinguish
them from the nacreous plates. At
the thinner end of the shell, about the edges,
the plates are all of this nature. They grow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>more friable and chalky as they incline to the
perpendicular, where the series are more numerous
and are situated at the thicker part of the
shell about the umbo.</p>

<p>Adjoining the inner edges of the middle shell
plates is the nacreous lining. In this the
calcium carbonate takes the same form as the
mineral aragonite and is identical with it. As
a mass however, the specific gravity is somewhat
less, owing to the inclusion of organic matter
with the mineral in the shell. This material is
harder, finer, more compact, and contains less
organic matter than that of which the middle
and outer shell is composed.</p>

<p>The lining is constructed of thin waves of
transparent calcium carbonate set in animal
tissue of great tenuity. This is the mother-of-pearl,
and the gem differs from it only in its
more or less rounded and independent formation.
The plates of which the lining is composed
lie almost parallel to the plates of the epidermis.
They are bent a little toward the interior at
the inner surface of the shell, but the general
sectional structure of a shell, cutting from the
umbo to the lip, is fairly represented by that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>stem of the letter X which extends from the
right upper to the left lower, the diagonal line
representing the middle shell; the horizontal
lines at the extremities show the general trend
of the epidermis and the nacreous lining. The
diagonal trend downward is from the epidermis
toward the boss-end of the shell.</p>

<p>The nacreous plates, or mother-of-pearl,
unlike those of the middle shell of the nigger-head,
cannot be easily separated. On cutting
them across the grain they appear as distinct
and separate strata and show dividing lines, yet
the mass is compact to a great degree. Upon
being broken, these strata separate only at the
edges, so that the entire set usually breaks
diagonally, showing a small strip of the surface
of each plate along the broken edge and forming
a series of ragged edge steps.</p>

<p>These plates or strata are composed of a great
many very thin waves following one upon the
other, and thereby producing series of fine,
irregular lines upon the surface which, though
trending generally in straight lines, curve and
twist about as do the edges of water waves, when
they run up on the sands of the sea-shore. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>the lapping of these thin transparent waves,
and the minute undulations of the layer edges
reflecting through the transparent plates, which
produce the soft luster peculiar to the linings
of the shells and the surface of pearls, and which
is known as "pearly."</p>

<p>The wave edges do not usually produce
iridescence, but if the waves are very thin and
transparent the undulating lines of many under
waves following close upon each other appear
on the surface, under the microscope, as dark
lines when the light is passed through the skin,
or silvery lines if the light be thrown upon it
from above; to the naked eye this becomes the
tempered brilliancy of the pearl's orient. Under
the microscope these waves appear to be constructed
of minute hexagonal plates or prisms
set in animal membrane.</p>

<p>A set of waves forming a plate, when broken
at right angles to the trend of the wave, shows
under the microscope a rough irregular edge,
and the small plates of which they are composed
sometimes appear separated individually from
the mass though more often they are dislodged
in clusters or strips. Broken with the trend of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>the wave edges, the plate breaks diagonally in
steps with undulating edges, which correspond
in appearance with the successive underlying
waves as they are seen through the surface under
the microscope.</p>

<p>Although distinct dividing lines between the
plates appear when a sectional cut is made
across the grain, there is no indication of a
division between the waves which make up the
plates, and there is no apparent difference in
the structure or compactness at the junction
of the plates though a clean division can only
be made there. It would appear, therefore,
that the plates mark intervals in the process of
construction and that the animal tissue is somewhat
thicker between the plates than between
the waves of which they are composed, where
the formative process has been continuous.</p>

<p>In all parts of the shell, the calcium carbonate
takes the hexagonal form: in the nacre, as thin
waves composed of hexagonal faces, and in the
middle shell and epidermis, as plates of hexagonal
particles grouped as hexagonal prisms
whose terminations form the front and back of
a plate. All the parts show a similar plan of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>construction, <i>i.e.</i>, separable plates composed of
thinner plates more compacted together, and
these in turn of infinitesimal hexagons of calcium
carbonate; full plates, component plates,
and particles, all alike surrounded by animal
tissue.</p>

<p>The shell is built up of secretions from the
water in which the oyster lives, made by the
mantle, a membraneous covering of the fish.
The function of this mantle, in part, is to
obtain from the water the elements required
and exude it at different parts of its folds
in the various forms required for the several
parts of the shell. The necessary lime exists
in the surrounding water and is supplied sometimes
by the calcareous beds upon which the
oysters grow, and in other cases by surrounding
vegetation.</p>

<p>In all mother-of-pearl oysters and the fresh-water
mussel unio, the lining is usually quite
thick, but in some pearl-bearing species having
small, frail shells, it is, though beautiful, too
thin to be of use. In the meleagrina, this
nacreous lining lies in the interior of the shell
like a congealed pearl wave, the smooth even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>rim following the curve of the shell about an
inch to an inch and a half within the jagged edge
of the epidermis, as shown in the Manilla shell
illustrated herewith, in which the lip, usually
trimmed off for commercial purposes, is preserved.
The lining of the meleagrina is not as
iridescent as that of the thin shell varieties.</p>

<p>Thus the shell is being constantly enlarged at
the edge, by a deposit of the exudations of the
mantle; conchiolin for the epidermis outside,
lime for the prisms and inner layers of transparent
plates, until the shell has attained its
full growth in size, after which some varieties
continue to lay on nacre only.</p>

<p class="caption">MANILA PEARL-SHELL WITH THE LIP CONSERVED</p>
</div>

<p>The linings of some have a black rim, extending
from the hinge on one side, around the edge
to the hinge on the other side. Viewed from the
edge this dark band appears to be a sixteenth
to half an inch wide (widest at the lip), fading
out as it becomes lost under the thicker white
nacre of the interior, but turn the shell up and
look at it squarely from the front and it is black
only around the extreme edge where it joins
the epidermis. This kind of shell is found in
the Pacific about the islands of Polynesia and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>called the black shell. In others the nacre is
white to the edge. The iridescence of the
white shell generally shows more play of color
than that of the black. The white shell is
usually somewhat flatter and broader than the
black, and the epidermis is light yellowish-brown.
This variety is found in great abundance
on the northern and western coasts of
Australia. The yellow, greenish and grayish
shells (these colors refer to the edge of the
lining), are similar in every way, but inferior,
the yellow being the best of the three.</p>

<p>The shell lining of a common form of the
unio, or fresh-water mussel pictured at page 146,
like that of the meleagrina, shows little iridescence
except at the edges outside the pallial
lines, where the nacre is comparatively thin,
and at the striated surface of the scar or bed of
the adductor muscle. In quality of color and
luster it is inferior to the nacre of the sea fish,
the white being more chalky in appearance and
the luster less pearly. The material of which
the shell is composed and its construction are
however almost identical with that of the salt-water
mollusk. In fact all shells are made of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>the same ingredients and are constructed on the
same general principles by the animals inhabiting
them.</p>

<p class="caption">MISSISSIPPI NIGGER-HEAD PEARL MUSSEL</p>
</div>

<p>This description of pearl shells has been given
here because a knowledge of the shell enables
one to understand the formation and characteristics
of a true pearl, and the differences which
exist between the gem and other similar formations
formed in pearl and other oysters, mussels,
and univalves. Many such formations are
found, having the elements and constructed
like one or both of the outer parts of the shell,
and some, in part like the lining, but these are
not true pearls; the gem has neither the
material nor construction of the middle and
outer shell. Except that the pearl, because of
its form, is rarely iridescent even to a slight
degree, whereas the nacreous lining of some
pearl-bearing shells is brilliantly so, the pearl
and the nacre of the shell in which it grows, are
essentially the same. Pearls are more or less
spherical and independent formations, made by
the fish on the same plan and from the same
secretions with which it lines the shell, misdirected
by abnormal conditions. Those constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
like any other part of the shell are not
true pearls.</p>

<p>The normal instinctive action of the mollusk
is self-protective and adaptive. By the secretive
action of its mantle it gathers from the
water in which it lives, material to build a shell
with a rough and rugged exterior for its enemies,
and adapted to resist the chemical activities
by which it is surrounded, and a perfectly
smooth lining suitable as an interposition for its
own delicate organism.</p>

<p>Barring accidents, the building functions of
the animal are employed only in the extension
of the shell to meet the needs of its own growth
and protection. But should a particle of
secretion intended for the shell, harden within
the folds of the oyster's mantle, or some parasite
or other intruder present itself within the nacre-forming
sphere, the instinctive action which
lines the rougher part of the shell is also directed
toward the foreigner, and it is at once covered
with a like deposit. This is the birth of a pearl,
and it grows layer by layer as long as it remains
within the scope of the nacre building instinct.
These layers, or skins as they are called, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>seldom iridescent. Occasionally a pearl of that
character is found, but it is generally from
a fresh-water mussel, and the nacreous plates
are of unusual tenuity.</p>

<p>Although the pearl like the lining of the
mollusk's shell is composed of carbonate of lime
in series of thin waves lapping each other, each
series constituting a plate or separable layer,
there is a distinct difference in construction.</p>

<p>Whereas the lining is a series of horizontal
layers, the pearl is made up of concentric layers,
each addition enveloping those preceding it.
These skins however are not always absolutely
distinct and separate. Instead of being like
a succession of globular skins, each completely
covered by its successor, the growth is often
spiral and the construction is as if the nucleus
had been rolled one, two, or three complete
revolutions in a continuous plate of nacre, and
the spiral envelope then finally merged into
another plate and the process repeated. That
which to a casual glance, therefore, appears to
be six rings of nacre in a sectional cut, is in
reality, several spirals of two or three turns
each.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<p>It is also noticeable that whereas the wave
edges, with all their eccentricities, trend generally
in one direction in the shell nacre, in the
pearl, the lines twist and curl with a concentric
tendency, as though the waves had been laid
on by turning or rolling the pearl in the material
of which it is composed.</p>

<p>A white pearl on being cut in half shows a
number of faint dark rings one within the other,
from the surface to the nucleus in the centre;
usually these rings occur at almost regular
intervals. Upon close examination under the
microscope, it will be seen that the inner part
of these intervals is white, and that the color
gradually changes to a yellowish tint which
deepens until it culminates in that which appears
as a dark line against the succeeding outer
formation, the material of which is also white
in the beginning. Although this change of
color is very slight, a section between two rings
will often show three distinct bands; the inner
white, the centre one faintly yellow and the
outer one of a deeper tint. In some cases the
dark concentric rings succeed each other very
closely, in which case no abrupt changes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>color between them are noticeable. The
material occupying the space between the rings
is the sectional appearance of the skin of pearl.
Upon applying a weak acid to the surface of an
entire section of a pearl, it effervesces, and the
inner colorless parts of the bands are at once
attacked. After several hours the white inner
part of the skins will show depressions where
the calcium carbonate has been dissolved, and
the outer parts of the skins will be marked by
coarse black rings of undissolved animal tissue,
similar in appearance to the epidermis of the
shell. Now as these skins are made up of many
very thin waves of calcium carbonate lapping
each other and set in animal tissue, it would
appear, therefore, that in the beginning these
waves of transparent calcium carbonate are set
in animal tissue of extreme tenuity and that
the proportion of animal tissue increases with
the growth of the skin until it reaches a stage
provocative of a new skin, which begins with
purer layers of the smoother crystallized mineral
like its predecessor, and identical with the
nacre of the shell. If this be so, it would account
for the various tints of color and degrees of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>luster in white pearls and for the fact that the
outer skins of very lustrous pearls are usually
very thin also. Similar conditions exist in
colored pearls, though the presence of a pigment
makes them less noticeable. The skins of
the haliotis pearl, which separate easily, usually
show remarkable luster on the inner surface.</p>

<p>Sometimes the nucleus is surrounded by a
confused mass without apparent concentric
markings, as though it had been enveloped in
nacre which had solidified while stationary,
or the first deposit shows the concentric skin
arrangement at one segment of the circle only;
followed by layers which appear in the depressions
of the mass and are continued until they
finally include the whole pearl. These layers
are usually very thin, and the partial or segmentary
layer formation is quite common in
the early stages of the pearl's growth. At that
period the concentric lines are also irregular,
and in many cases where the curve is true, they
extend about one quarter of the circumference
only, another concentric skin being lapped on
the ends, as though the globular skin had been
formed in sections.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>As before stated, it often happens that the
skin division lines are spiral, as though the
nucleus had been rolled one way in the nacreous
material. In all cases the first deposits of a
skin, that is the first of the nacreous waves of
which a skin is composed, appear to be most
transparent and lustrous. The component
waves of nacre then gradually become more
impregnated with animal tissue until they
apparently reach a stage which induces either
a rest on the part of the fish, to gather nacreous
material, or a new deposit of less impure nacre,
to protect itself from the increasing impurity
of the pearl's skin.</p>

<p>The skins undoubtedly mark certain stages
in the formation of the pearl, though the skin
and the nacreous waves of which it is composed
are often confounded. In the skinning of pearls
an entire skin is seldom peeled off. The surface
is scraped, a number of the component waves
being taken off, until the luster is improved and
it is then supposed that the entire outer skin
has been removed. A close examination however,
will show, by breakages in the surface of
the waves, that the under skin with its peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>and systematic arrangement of surface wave
edges, has not been reached.</p>

<p>A sectional view as seen in a half pearl would
lead one to infer that a free pearl in the beginning
lies stationary in the oyster; is turned or
partially rolled as it grows larger; and finally,
on attaining about a one grain size, is kept in
constant motion with a concentric rolling in
the nacreous exudations of the mantle which
are deposited upon it.</p>

<p>The nuclei of pearls were long thought to be
grains of sand, but late and careful research
has shown that in the majority of cases they
are minute parasitic or domiciliary worms.</p>

<p>Professor Herdman and James Hornell, after
three consecutive inspections of the oyster
banks in the Gulf of Manaar in 1902-3, stated
in a paper contributed to the British Association
for the advancement of science, that after
examining many hundreds of oysters and
decalcifying a large number of pearls, they had
come to the conclusion, that grains of sand and
other inorganic particles formed the nuclei of
pearls only under exceptional circumstances, as
for instance, when the shell was injured by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>breaking of the ears, which would enable sand
to get into the interior.</p>

<p>Pearls, or pearly excrescences on the interior
of the shell, were due to the intrusion of leucodore,
clione and other borers. Pearls found in
the mussels, especially at the levator and pallial
insertions, were formed around calcospherules,
minute calcareous concretions produced in the
tissues. But most of the fine pearls found free
in the body of the Ceylon oyster, contained the
remains of platyhelminthian parasites. These
observations agree with the opinions formed,
after careful study, by several eminent conchologists.</p>

<p>The action of the mollusk results differently
as the object to be covered is free within the
folds of the creature's mantle or, rising above
the surface of the nacreous lining, presses upon
it. If free, the intruder is enveloped by the
animal's exudations and the deposits become
concentric instead of level, or nearly so, as in
the construction of the shell. It is said that the
foreign substance acts as an irritant, causing the
fish to exude its secretions abnormally in order
to protect itself, and thereby creating a diseased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>condition; but from the fact that the process
continues after the intruder has been enveloped
and rendered as non-irritant as the natural
lining of the shell, it would appear that the
introduction of a foreign element simply draws
upon it the normal impulse of the fish to cover
with nacre anything with which it comes in
contact, and that the method of doing it is
similar to the instinctive rolling action of the
tongue when some insoluble globule is put in
the mouth, for not only do free pearls grow
spherically, but a nucleus fast to the shell
is not covered simply but it grows to a pearl,
round and domelike, as nearly spherical as
its juncture with the shell will permit.</p>

<p>Not only is the composition of a pearl identical
with the lining of the shell where it is
formed, but in a general way its appearance
and characteristics are the same, except that
free pearls are sometimes colored when the
nacre of the shell is white.</p>

<p>Button pearls, warts and baroques, grown
fast to the shell, are usually like the surrounding
nacre in every respect.</p>

<p>Salt-water pearls are characterized by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>soft velvety luster of the oriental mother-of-pearl,
and fresh-waters, like the lining of the
unio, have a somewhat thinner looking and
more chalky texture.</p>

<p>Abalone pearls have the irregular surface and
coloring of the haliotis. Conch pearls resemble
the delicate pink china-like lining of the shell,
and clam pearls have the glazed earthenware
appearance of the inside of a clam shell. The
one material difference between a pearl and the
lining of the shell in which it grows is, that in
the one case the fish deposits the nacre over an
even surface, and in the other wraps it around
a central point with delicate precision in successive
filmy layers.</p>

<p>Dissection shows that a pearl during growth
is liable to many mishaps. As with the human
creature, a promising youth may end in a
wretched maturity. It is also possible that an
ugly period may be redeemed by later happenings,
and the thing that was worthless in its
early existence, be found in its age worthy of
a place among the great gems. Pearls found
with a dull, chalky exterior sometimes have
lustrous skins beneath. Sometimes a bony-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
formation will be found, on breaking
it, to have a variety of skins in the interior,
some of which are very lustrous, others white
and chalky, like the middle shell of the mollusk.</p>

<p>Many of these dead pearls are formed throughout
of this material. Others, perfectly spherical,
are simply successive layers of prism groups
like the conchiolin plates of the shell. Upon
cutting these through the centre the skins are
shown by the concentric rings marking their
divisions and the prismatic formation appears
as glistening lines radiating from the nucleus
to the surface. Under the microscope these
layers, which are thicker than the nacreous
skins of true pearls, appear identical with the
epidermis plates, except that they are concentric
instead of flat, and are free from the coarse,
rough, conchiolin deposit which forms the
extreme outer coating of the shells. This
deposit is also found, however, in some pearl
formations, as many of the abalone baroques,
especially when they are somewhat flat in
shape, are like two pearl blisters joined, with
the shell-building process reversed, the rough,
black conchiolin being inside, and the nacre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>outside. Undoubtedly pearls containing hidden
qualities which made them once gems are
thrown away as valueless, while others found
just as nature had covered their earlier coarseness
with a coat of beauty, are worn and
excite much admiration for their skin-deep
beauty.</p>

<p>Though the successive skins of a pearl do
not usually vary much in color, except in
abalone pearls, it does happen occasionally,
for the removal of dark yellow skins sometimes
discloses another of better colorâ€”a
good pink for instance. From the sectional
appearance of pearls it seems probable, that
in the majority of cases the color of yellow
pearls would be improved by the removal of
the outer waves of the outer skin.</p>

<p>Changes in shape sometimes occur during
the growth of the pearl, the tendency being
always toward the rounding of the surface.
If the nucleus is fast to the shell, a dome
is built over and around it. If the nucleus
permits, the nacre is deposited not only over
but under its edges to the point of contact with
the shell, so that a button pearl connected with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>the shell at the centre only, results. Two pearls
held against the shell and growing side by side
are separately enveloped until they touch each
other, after which they are included in single
deposits of nacre and the depression between
their domes becomes less distinct with each
successive coating. Similarly, a cluster of small
pearls lying together often forms the nucleus
of a large rounded baroque or button pearl.
Examination of such formations shows, that
up to a certain period the pearls have a separate
existence and growth. They then become
joined in an irregular mass of twinned pearls,
and finally, if allowed to remain in the oyster
long enough, all individuality is lost in the
tendency to round over. The same thing occurs
when grains of sand or other intrusions become
attached to a growing pearl. They are quite
prominent when first included in the nacreous
deposit and can be easily detached from the
under pearl by breaking through the layer which
binds them on; but they are soon obliterated
by succeeding deposits. This filling-in process
is sometimes accomplished by additional layers
in the depression, sometimes by thicker layers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>It happens occasionally, when skinning a
round pearl, that one of these fillings is uncovered
and flakes out, leaving the pearl irregular,
as it was in a former stage of its growth.</p>

<p>Although pearls naturally grow spherically,
many free pearls are more or less buttoned, that
is, have a flat place from which the pearl rises
like a dome, high or low. This happens when
the pearl is held during growth by the fish
against the shell with a part of its body intervening.
According to circumstances, the pearl
varies in form from slightly button, to a low
dome, rising from a plane at its greatest diameter.
Should a pearl of this description become
dislodged, the rounding action of the mollusk
would begin at once to obliterate the plane.</p>

<p>If undisturbed, the process would result
eventually in changing the button to a round
or nearly round pearl, but should the pearl be
taken from the fish before the metamorphosis
is completed, a depression, or pit, would mar
its contour. When borers intrude through the
shell, the presentation is at once covered with
nacre, and successive deposits are built up
around it resulting in the nacreous wart known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>as a baroque. The rounding action of the
mollusk is clearly shown in these excrescences,
as the borer is not simply covered and levelled
with the shell, but the slight elevation above
the level of the lining receives a continuity of
concentric deposits which finally raise it very
considerably above the surface and separate it
in construction from the lining to which it is
attached. The shell herewith reproduced illustrates
the result. Borers pierced it at the thick
part of the hinge, and burrowing down, entered
the interior at the point where the baroque is
shown. In rare instances, pearls attached to
the shell do escape the concentric deposition,
for they have been found buried under even
layers of nacre, when the mother-of-pearl was
cut up in the process of manufacture.</p>

<p class="caption">VENEZUELAN PEARL-SHELL, SHOWING BAROQUE</p>
</div>

<p>From the appearance of the striÃ¦ when they
are divided lengthwise, pear-shaped pearls
appear to have been spherical at one time.
During a stage in the growth, the forming
layer has curved away from the centre at one
section of the sphere to a point. Succeeding
layers, following the innovation, are deposited
around the extension until it becomes sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
elongated to give the pearl the obovoid
form.</p>

<p>Many pearls are shaped like a capsule. The
ends of most are rounded up to a full dome;
some have somewhat flatter ends; many are
long and cylindrical like an ordinary capsule;
others are short and appear in shape like two
high button pearls joined at their bases; while
some resemble a cartridge, one end being almost
flat and the other a somewhat pointed dome.
It is noticeable that such pearls have a chalky
line around the middle, and sometimes there
is a lustrous band between two. These chalky
lines are found, on peeling such a pearl, to
extend through all the interior layers. Similarly,
a high button joined at its entire circumference
to the shell, if the junction is abrupt,
has an intersecting chalky line, marking the
juncture of the two, between the luster of the
pearl and the shell lining. If the base of the
pearl and the shell form a curve there is no
chalky line of demarcation.</p>

<p>This suggests that whenever the animal is
unable to envelop the thing upon which the
mantle deposits its secretions completely or is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>not in touch with every part of it, there is at
the extremity of its action, an unnacreous
deposit, corresponding to the deposit of conchiolin
or calcite, at the extreme edge of the
shell which precedes the nacreous layers following
within and slightly back of it. As the luster
of the pearl arises from the transparency of the
calcium carbonate modified by the undulating
lines formed by the edges of the wave-plates,
it may be that the lapping action of the mantle
is necessary for the regular formation and
crystallization of these plates, and that at
points beyond the reach of this action, the
depositions of the mantle are therefore not
pearly.</p>

<p>Much is necessarily conjectural as to the
modus operandi by which the shell and the
pearl are formed but the invariable tendency
toward sphericity suggests that the nucleus
of a pearl, when free within the mollusk's
mantle, is not only enveloped in its exudations,
but is either kept constantly moving with a
rolling motion or lapped on all sides by the
membrane which exudes upon it the nacreous
material.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<p>The instances cited of the short capsule
shaped pearl and the high button joined to the
shell, which seem to escape the nacreous deposit
at the basis of the domes, favor the lapping or
licking method of depositing the nacreous solution
and this action by the mollusk would
result in a constant rolling or turning motion
imparted to the object if it were free within the
creature's body. The licking and rolling action
of the mollusk, modified by the conceivable
influences of position in the shell, would account
for the spherical form with all the various modifications
in which the pearl is found.</p>

<p>To account for the variation of quality which
undoubtedly exists in the successive skins of
some pearls, and the imperfections in the nacre
of the same skin, the theory has been advanced
that the secretions for the lining, the shell
proper, and the epidermis, are exuded by different
parts of the mantle; the pearl traverses
during growth these different bands and its
skins are modified by the secretions, as they
come within the various zones of influence. But
there are several facts which seem to oppose the
theory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>In the first place all these parts of the mantle
which supply the material for the epidermis,
the middle shell, and the lining, are enclosed
within the shell and in touch with the lining yet
each receives the exudations of that part of the
mantle which supplies the material suitable for
it, the mantle invariably pushing the coarser
excretions outwardly to the shell's exterior.
Again, whatever the quality of the skin of the
pearl may be, it is never of conchiolin like the
outer epidermis and though sometimes similar
to the plates, of which the conchiolin is the
exposed fringe, it always contains sufficient
nacre to render the surface smooth. The fact
that the skins of a pearl do sometimes correspond
with the different parts of the shell, and
that the same skin on the surface is occasionally
partly nacreous and unnacreous, in connection
with the variation of quality which exists in
the internal composition of the skin, favors an
idea that the mixed and variable quantity of
nacre in the skins may be caused by the abnormal
position of the mantle wrapped about the
growing pearl which would thereby come more
or less under the influence of the calcite and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>conchiolin zones distorted from their normal
extension and action.</p>

<p>It has also been suggested that the oyster
deposits the nacreous layer in a fluid state and
then rests until the deposit hardens, when the
process is repeated. To a certain extent this
may be true though apparently it could not be
a yearly process as pearls found in the small
varieties of the avicula which mature in four
to six years and die out in seven years, often
contain a greater number of layers than the
years of the mollusk's life, and no pearl is ever
found with a soft exterior, though it seems
possible that pearls with a dead white chalky
exterior are taken from the oyster at a period
when the crystallization of the outer skin has
not been perfected, or that they have escaped
some action, chemical or of the animal, necessary
for the formation of the lustrous waves of nacre.
Mr. Ludwig Stross, who has had much experience
at the pearl fisheries, says that he has frequently
found pearls of fair size in shells of the Lingah
type which could not be over twelve to fifteen
months old. Some of these pearls weighed fully
three grains. As there are many apparent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>skins in a pearl of that size, the divisions
could not mark either years, seasons, or breeding
periods. In some experiments made by Mr.
Stross, he found that borings made to the interior
of a living mollusk's shell were closed by a
film of hard nacre in two days.</p>

<p>The known facts about a pearl are these. It
is composed of about ninety-two per cent. carbonate
of lime, about six per cent. organic
matter and a little over two per cent. water in
combination almost identical with the lining of
the shell in which it grows and similar to the
mineral aragonite. In construction it is usually
a series of layers, which can sometimes be peeled
off entirely, each one successively enveloping
its predecessors apparently as an independent
structure though itself composed of a number
of thin lapping waves. Upon cutting through
these layers the divisions appear as a series of
rings and the intervals, though composed of
many thin waves, appear compact. It grows
spherically or with such modifications as the
exigencies of position in the shell would reasonably
account for. These facts seem to justify
the hypothesis that a foreign substance upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>entering the shell of a pearl oyster is at once
enveloped or washed in the creature's exudations;
that the organic matter of the secretions
forms a filmy envelope in which the mineral
contained in them is precipitated or crystallizes
in wave-like layers of crystals of great
tenuity, and that as these layers harden the
process is repeated, and that during the process
the creature either revolves the object, or about
it, as it is free, or fastened to the shell. It is
also possible that changes in the organic matter
interwoven with the calcium carbonate may
produce some chemical action resulting in the
crystallization of the lime, and the crystallization
in turn be provocative of another deposit,
each process in turn being almost simultaneous
and that the process is continued until a paucity
of mineral in the exudations induces a rest for
recuperation, after which the process is repeated,
the result being a succession of composite skins
as we find them. Whatever the cause, it is
evident in all parts of the shell and in the pearl
that continuity of construction is periodically
arrested to be resumed upon exactly the same
plan, except that the material used in the succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
layer of the pearl may be formed
occasionally like another of the shell sections
though usually it is like the preceding one.</p>

<p>Marked differences in the same skin occur
more frequently in the pearl formations of
univalves. The skins of the abalone pearl
especially, are frequently nacreous in part only.</p>

<p>Pearl oysters are found in immense numbers
on banks having a calcareous foundation. They
are extraordinarily prolific, the spat of one
oyster being estimated at upwards of several
hundred thousands to millions, so that were it
not for the natural enemies of their young and
the liability of being swept away and scattered
by storms before they have anchored, the banks
would be over-crowded with the myriads produced.
Some idea of the numbers may be
gained from the fact that during the fishing
season the Ceylon divers raise about one million
each day.</p>

<p>The oysters are seldom found in water with
a temperature below 75 degrees and they seem
to thrive best in warm sheltered bays and inlets,
especially when the banks are situated far from
the equator. They attach themselves to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>beds by a bunch of tough threads which pass
out through an aperture in the shells, near the
hinge, and fasten on the rocks and stones;
consequently the oysters do not lie flat, as might
be supposed, but maintain an upright position,
hinge down, lip end up, and the shell slightly
open for the passage of the food-laden water,
as the fresh-water mussels do. These threads
are called the beard or byssus, and are composed
of material similar to the epidermis of the shell.</p>

<p>The abalone, which is a univalve, holds on to
the rocks by the foot, a flat muscular appendage
used for locomotion and also as an anchor on
the principle of the leather toy known to boys
as a sucker.</p>

<p>Although pearls of value are found only in
shells containing mother-of-pearl, a small proportion
only of the mother-of-pearl shells contains
pearls, and many varieties in which pearls
are found do not yield enough nacre to make the
shells valuable. The size of the meleagrina in
some seas is remarkable. That at page 127,
photographed from a Tuamotu shell, measures
8-7/8 inches by 6-7/8 inches and weighs twenty-eight
ounces troy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>It is of the black-edge variety, contains a
large quantity of fine quality mother-of-pearl,
and has a beautiful small pearl attached to the
lining near the center of the shell. Though large,
it is not full grown. It is probably twelve to
fourteen years old and would continue to lay
on mother-of-pearl and so grow thicker and
heavier until sixteen to eighteen years of age,
when the oyster would reach maturity. The
Australian white shell at page 129 is a young
shellâ€”that is, it has not attained the full thickness
and weight of a mature shell. The shells
at pages 131 and 161 are from the coast of
Venezuela; they measure 2-1/4 by 2-1/4 inches and
weigh seven pennyweights each.</p>

<p>The common form of the pearl-bearing fresh-water
mussel unio (nigger-head) is illustrated
at page 146. This shell measures 3-3/4 by 2-3/4
inches and weighs 3-1/2 ounces. It is from the
Middle West of the United States. In construction
it resembles the meleagrina, the
epidermis being dark, though not as rough as
that of the oyster, and the lining white, showing
slight iridescence around the lip-edge and
to a greater degree on the adductor muscle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>scar. The mother-of-pearl under the epidermis
at the thick or hinge end is quite iridescent, and
the lines which make the color play are plainly
discernible under the loup.</p>

<p>The largest and finest pearls, also the greatest
number, are found usually in distorted shells.
This has given rise to the idea that they are a
symptom of disease in the fish, but having in
mind the functions of the three zones of the
creature's mantle by which they supply separately
material for the epidermis, middle shell
and lining, one may conceive that if, by some
extraordinary cause, the secretions of one of
these is largely withdrawn from the natural
channel, the losing part of the shell would warp
the normal growth of the others to its own
dwarfage.</p>

<p>When the nacre grows to a pearl, contrary to
the intent of nature, instead of a lining for the
shell endeavoring to keep pace with the growing
oyster, the full-growing exterior is distorted in
accommodating itself to the undersized lining.
In view of the fact that an oyster sometimes
contains a large number of pearls (one shell in
New Caledonia contained 256) the diversion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>nacre sufficient to cover them, or to produce
one large pearl, might reasonably be expected
to result in a considerable distortion of the
shell. It may also be that the displacement of
the mantle, caused by the wrapping of itself
about the growing pearl, interferes with the
even deposit of shell material about the edges
of the shell and so distorts it.</p>

<p>Because deformed shells are more fruitful of
pearls some have advocated the practice of
throwing perfectly-formed shells back into the
sea unopened, but, inasmuch as the mother-of-pearl
of the shells often exceeds in value the
pearls found in them, this is not likely to happen.
Few fisheries could be made to pay if they were
fished for the pearls alone. In many of them
the shells yield 90 per cent. of the total value
and are in fact the sole incentive for the investment
of the necessary capital.</p>

<p>Luckily for the world's supply of pearls, however,
the disturbers of the mollusk which cause
these gems by their intrusions appear to be
more abundant in waters where the shell is
valueless, the banks about Ceylon especially
being infested with the cestodes which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>commonly the nuclei of Indian pearls. It is
interesting also to learn that Mr. James Hornell
(inspector of the pearl banks) finds these worms
in another stage in the file-fish, which frequents
the banks to prey upon the oysters, and confidently
expects to find them in the adult stage
in the shark, which in turn devours the file-fish.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of Jameson of London and
others, that the parasite which causes the formation
of pearls in the mussels of Europe is frequently
the larva of distomum somaterÅ“, from
the eider-duck and scoter, and that the larva
first inhabits Tapes, or the cockle, before getting
into the mussel.</p>

<p>Generally the nuclei appear to be the bodies
or eggs of minute parasitesâ€”distoma, filaria,
bucephalus, etc., and they vary in different
localities according to the animal life of the
neighborhood. In the still parts of the river
Elster, where water-mites (Limnochares anodontÅ“)
were abundant, Kuchenmeister found
that the mollusks contained more pearls.</p>

<h2>METHODS OF FISHING</h2>


<p>The beds of the marine shell-fish from which
pearls are taken lie always under water. Unlike
others which are sometimes left exposed by the
tides, to be gathered by man without difficulty,
the pearl oyster is never left uncovered by the
sea. It is found usually on shoals some distance
from shore, sometimes but five to seven feet
from the surface; more frequently fifteen to
forty feet deep, and often one hundred to one
hundred and twenty-five and even one hundred
and fifty feet deep.</p>

<p>Everywhere, then, man's quest for pearls is
confronted by the heaving, restless waters of
the sea, for the greater part of the year rough
and turbulent, frequently lashed to furious
racing by tropic tempests but through which
he must in any case go to get them. In a few
places where the beds lie in shallow inlets and
sheltered bays they can be dredged, but almost
universally the oysters are gathered by divers.
During the greater part of the year, when storms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>rage, diving is very dangerous if not quite
impossible; but when the song of the sea is
hushed to low crooning, and the gentle roll of
the waves does no more than playfully slap
the boats in passing, then in the seas where
men dive for pearls they gather to the harvest
of gems.</p>

<p>There are two ways of divingâ€”naked, and
with dress. The former is the common method
throughout the Orient and is practised to-day
after the same manner that it was in the days
of the Pharaohs and the CÃ¦sars, for the primitive
method survives with few variations
wherever eastern people control the fisheries.</p>

<p>In the fishing season one sees now in the Red
Sea and the Persian Gulf and about Ceylon,
the same scenes as they were enacted there
before Rome was a city, or France a nation,
or the Macedonians overran Egypt. Naked
divers, diving into fifteen to forty feet of water,
use few aids. They grease their bodies, put
greased cotton in the ears and a forked stick,
or tortoise-shell clip, upon the nostrils to compress
them, hang a wide-mouthed wicker basket
or net at the waist, and they are ready.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<p>There are several methods of naked diving:
head-first from a spring-board attached to the
side of the boat, as the Malabar coast Hindus
and some of the Egyptians do; swimming to
the bottom, as practised in the deep waters of
the South Sea; and dropping to the oyster bed
with a stone. The latter is the most common
way in Indian, Egyptian, and Arabian waters,
especially where the banks lie in forty to fifty
feet of water.</p>

<p>Standing on the spring-board a few seconds
to fill his lungs, the head-first diver suddenly
plunges overboard and passes smoothly and
rapidly through the water straight to the shoal
below. Gathering quickly as many oysters as
possible while his breath lasts, he places them
in the net at his waist, attaches them to a convenient
rope hanging from the boat's side and
shoots to the surface. There he recuperates by
lazily floating about if the water is shallow, if
deeper, by climbing back into the boat for his
next plunge. If diving in pairs, one rests while
his partner dives.</p>

<p>Expert divers who dive singly have an
attendant, a manduck, who attends to the lines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>and looks out for his interests generally. The
manduck drops a line with the oyster basket
overboard and attaches to it another weighted
with a forty to fifty pound stone. These are so
fastened that they can be quickly released. The
diver then drops into the water feet first and
placing his foot in a loop in the line over the
stone puts the basket on it, and releasing the
lines, sinks to the bottom. Disengaging himself,
he proceeds to fill his basket while the
attendant pulls up the stone and adjusts it for
the next descent. When ready to return he
signals his attendant, and holding on to the
line with the basket is drawn to the surface,
occasionally accelerating his own return by
climbing the rope hand over hand at the same
time. He rests in the water by the boat's side
until ready to dive again, making seven or
eight descents before climbing into the boat for
a longer rest and sun-bath.</p>

<p>The divers of India, Arabia and the Red Sea
are natives of the Madras Presidency, descendants
of Arab fishers at Jaffna in Ceylon,
Arabs, and Egyptian Negroes. They travel
long distances to the fisheries and there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>many of them between the Red Sea and Ceylon.
At the last fishing in the Gulf of Manaar there
were about forty-five hundred. Their dress
during the time of the fishing consists of a loin
cloth only. They have many hereditary and
class superstitions, chief of which is their faith
in shark-charmers. While waiting for the fishing
to begin they also seek to get from the
fates an inkling of the luck which will attend
them. One common method is by breaking a
cocoanut on the diving stone; the more clean
and even the break, the better the luck.</p>

<p>The mortality among divers at the fisheries
is not great in Asiatic waters. Pneumonia is
the greatest scourge, fatalities in diving being
few. It is necessary however to select robust
men for depths beyond forty feet; comparatively
few can work without injurious effects
below that.</p>

<p>Some curious mixtures of ancient days and
present times, of the Pharaohs and infant
industries, are seen. One may see a black slave
diver in the Red Sea hanging over the edge of
his boat taking observations through an old
tin kerosene can with a bit of glass in one end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>it. This he sinks a little way in the water and
gazes through it below. Presently the can is
discarded, over he goes and returns shortly
with a few shells; while near by a clumsy
monster emerges and a diver in dress climbs
into his boat. This use of modern tin cans and
glass is adopted in seas where the shells are
scattered and is common to pearl-divers the
world over.</p>

<p>The Moros have a method of fishing in very
calm weather peculiar to themselves. They
drop a three-prong catcher attached to a rattan
rope upon the oyster bunches and so haul them
up to the boat. This can only be done when the
sea is perfectly still, as even a ripple would
render a sight of the oysters impossible. Ordinarily
they dive to any depth down to twenty
fathoms.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to introduce
dress-diving among the natives of the east but
so far few have been successful. Results from
experiments have not compared favorably with
naked diving and so, with few exceptions, naked
diving is still the rule in the east where natives
control the fishings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<p>But of all, the Polynesians, both male and
female, adhere most closely to the old way.
Most of them will not even use a stone to assist
the descent, and they probably reach greater
depths than the naked divers of any other sea.
Travellers report that, at a coral atoll in the
Southern Pacific owned by the French government
and known as Hikuereu, where the natives
of Tahiti and other islands flock during the
season to fish for pearls, the boys and girls and
women are almost as expert as the men.</p>

<p>Whole families congregate here, remaining
during the season housed in huts framed of
light cocoanut palms roofed with leaves. These
they bring with them, some coming several
hundred miles. The shells are mostly in sixty
to seventy feet of water; some however are
brought from a depth of one hundred feet. It
is reported that a boy, on an exhibition dive,
remained under water for two minutes and forty
seconds, going to a depth of a little over one
hundred feet. He was in sight all the time, the
water being so transparent that he could be seen
on the bottom, leisurely selecting pieces of coral
for the officers of the ship above. These divers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>hang in the water by one hand grasping the gunwale
of the boat while they examine the bottom
for oysters through a glass which they hold
below the surface in the other hand.</p>

<p>When shells are sighted the glass is discarded,
the lungs are filled several times and the air
expelled slowly. Upon reaching a certain fit
condition a long breath is taken until the lungs
are inflated to their utmost capacity; the diver
then suddenly lets go, sinks a few feet below the
surface, turns quickly and head-first swims
rapidly to the bottom.</p>

<p>Arriving there, he pulls himself along by
grasping the coral branches and breaking the
shells loose from their anchorage with his right
hand, which is protected by a cloth wrapping,
and stows them away in a cocoanut fibre basket
slung over the shoulder. This done, he straightens
himself and shoots to the surface with
astonishing rapidity, seeming to leap up from
the water as he arrives with almost sufficient
impetus to carry him into the waiting canoe.
In a few minutes he is ready to dive again. In
some localities where divers were employed the
women were preferred, not because they could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>do better work always, but one could depend
on them more safely. This was true of the
divers in Torres Straits between Queensland
and New Guinea.</p>

<p>Before dress-diving was introduced these
naked natives would dive into ten or twelve
fathoms and bring up an oyster under each arm.
The shells were large, weighing three to six
pounds together and sometimes ten, but they
contained few pearls and those were generally
small. As they were brought up the oysters
were searched for pearls and the fish used for
food. The shells sold in Sydney then for eight
to nine hundred dollars the ton. Years ago the
women of Chile about the Bay of Concepcion
claimed as a right the fishing for mussels. The
men rowed them out to the beds and stuck long
poles into the shoal below, down which the
women would slide, returning with both hands
full of mussels. The fishing was done from
canoes, each holding one man and one woman.
The women did not consider this a hardship but
a privilege of which they were quite jealous, for
they devoted the proceeds of their catch to the
purchase of finery.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<p>Wonderful stories are told of the great depths
to which these naked divers go and the great
length of time they can remain under water.
Many of these tales are gross exaggerations,â€”yarns
which have grown more wonderful with
the telling, or the reports of careless or inexperienced
observers. As a matter of fact at most
of the fisheries, twenty to thirty feet is good
diving, and from forty to fifty feet is the maximum
depth. Sixty to eighty seconds is the average
limit of time they remain under water. If
one will try to hold the breath for sixty seconds,
even while remaining perfectly still, it will be
at once understood that to do so while moving
and working rapidly under water is a great feat.
Nevertheless there have been instances undoubtedly,
where naked divers have gone to much
greater depths and remained under for several
minutes. Such cases are rare however and
occur most frequently among the natives of the
South Sea Islands, who, male and female, are
expert divers from childhood and spend much
of their lives in the water.</p>

<p>Visitors have claimed that natives of the
Tongarewa Islands, in longitude one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>and fifty-eight degrees W. and latitude nine
degrees S., can do twenty to twenty-five fathoms
and will even go deeper when tempted by the
sight of a few oysters lying in a hole or depression
near by. Going below twenty-five fathoms
results almost invariably in a sort of paralysis.
The diver comes up howling and incapable of
motion and unless companions at once seize
and rub him vigorously with salt water until
circulation is restored, a process lasting sometimes
many hours, he dives no more. If
restored he will dive again next day, and such
is their recklessness that the same temptation
would lead him to take the risk again.</p>

<p>Monsters abound in these waters. Should
the diver be attacked by a devil-fish, shark, or
sword-fish, he does not use a knife, as blood
would attract other devils of the sea and
becloud the water to his own confusion. Instead
he seeks to avoid his enemy, and if the troubler
is a sword-fish, tries to find shelter among the
rocks. If the fish departs quickly, he escapes;
but the time of a live man one hundred feet
under water is short and sometimes the sword-fish
over-stays it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<p>Helmets have been used to a certain extent
in all parts of the world. Many of them were
clumsy affairs, abhorred by all native divers,
and were a bad introduction to the "dress"
used in the large operations of big fisheries such
as those of Australia and the Pacific coast of
this continent. In the seas about Australia,
modern appliances are being rapidly introduced.
The Australians use them if possible, wherever
they fish. On their own coast all diving is now
done in dress; but among some of the islands of
the Pacific, where they are extending their
interests, native prejudice is still able to hinder
the use of it.</p>

<p>Probably the chief reason for the general use
of the dress on the Australian coast so early
was that the shallows were soon exhausted,
and naked diving was not successful beyond a
depth of fifty feet. With the dress, a diver can
work at much greater depths, remain under
water an hour or two, and work all the year
round.</p>

<p class="caption">NATIVE AUSTRALIAN PEARL-DIVERS</p>
</div>

<p>In fisheries like those of Ceylon, where the
banks are seldom over forty feet deep and well
known, being fished over and over again at one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>season of the year only, at comparatively short
intervals (four to six years), the necessity for
dress-diving is less and the naked native diver
will probably survive for many years although
modern innovations are gradually creeping in
even among the fisheries controlled by Orientals.</p>

<p>The dress consists of a rubber suit all in one
piece, which the diver gets into through the
neck; leaden-soled boots, corselet to which the
helmet is screwed, and chest and back weights.
The diver dresses and steps on to the ladder
hanging over the boat's side. The air-pipe, life-line,
and helmet are attached, the man at the
air-pump is set to work, and last of all the face
glass is screwed up.</p>

<p>A plunge, a splash, and he drops swiftly
through the heaving billows to the quiet depths
below, his life in the hands of the tender he has
left in the boat. This man must feel the diver
constantly by the life-line, keep him supplied
with air and be ready for any of the emergencies
always liable to arise. Only an alert man
of good judgment and quick action should tend
the life-line, though the most successful diver,
a Japanese, on the Australian coast some years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>ago, had the best tender of that section in the
person of his wife.</p>

<p>If it is the diver's first plunge, his ears and
head will be racked with pain as he descends.
This pain will leave him when he reaches
bottom, but on his return to the surface he will
find his nose and ears bleeding and will probably
spit blood also. After this he will not experience
pain in diving, but in common with nearly all
divers will never be quite free from extreme
irritability and bad temper while below; he
will also have gained the diver's ability to blow
smoke through the ears.</p>

<p>Diving is injurious to the health and, if persisted
in, produces deafness and incipient
paralysis. Few of the divers on the Australian
coast now are aborigines. Their antipathy to
the dress amounted in many cases to a superstition,
so as the fishing was pushed out to deeper
waters and the dress became a necessity, they
were discarded with the old methods. It is said
that in the old times diving had a peculiar effect
upon the black-haired natives. By the end of
the fishing season the color of their hair became
yellow though the natural hue returned later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>With the dress, a diver can work comfortably
at one hundred to a hundred and twenty-five
feet, but men who know the fisheries doubt if
that can be exceeded. Nor does it seem needful
to go deeper, for in seas which have been
explored at greater depths it is usually found
that the bottom consists of ooze unsuitable for
the life and growth of the oyster.</p>

<p>Beyond those inherent to the art of diving,
either method has its peculiar difficulties after
bottom is reached. In naked diving, especially
at the shoals of Ceylon and Venezuela, where
the shells are small and abundant, it is simply
a question of gathering as many as possible
while the breath lasts and looking out for the
dangerous fishes indigenous to tropical waters.</p>

<p>Sharks are common in many of the pearl-oyster
seas, but experienced divers do not fear
them greatly, as the fish, formidable as it may
appear, and dangerous as it is when it can come
upon one unawares, is easily frightened. Many
expert swimmers of the Indian and Pacific
oceans do not hesitate to attack them in their
own element. Usually vigorous splashing will
frighten them away. The dress-divers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>Australia scare them off by allowing a jet of air
to escape. As the bubbles start for him, the
man-eating monster shoots away from them as
if terror-stricken.</p>

<p>The diamond-flounder of the Pacific and
Indian oceans, a huge flat fish with a habit of
seizing its prey between the side fins and
crushing it, is more dangerous. If a dress-diver
of experience sees one of these approaching,
he is apt to shut off the air-escape of his
helmet and signal to his tender that he is
coming to the surface as fast as he can get
there.</p>

<p>The rock-cod also is sometimes troublesome
on the Australian coast. Occasionally he
attains an enormous size. This fish lies hidden
in submarine caves, his head protruding and
his monstrous jaws yawning vertically wide
like an entrance to the cave itself. But accidents
from the denizens of the sea are comparatively
few; the physical results of deep-sea
diving are more to be dreaded, for paralysis
hovers close to the thirty-fathom line.</p>

<p>Although dress-diving has the advantage
over naked diving that it gives a supply of air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>to breathe while at work, it also entails dangers
and difficulties from which the old method is
free. An imperfect supply of air may cause the
bursting of a blood-vessel. Fouling of the lines
might not only cut off the air supply entirely,
but prevent the man, anchored by his heavy
dress under twenty fathoms of water more or
less, from signalling the man at the life-line.
As on dry land, there are holes and precipices
at the bottom of the sea to be avoided.</p>

<p>In some seas there are swift currents and as
the dress-diver remains under water for some
time, instead of returning at once like his naked
brother, he must keep moving with it, and as
he moves, the boat must move in unison and
his tender must keep the lines free. Both diver
and tender must be skilful and alert to do this.
Nor is it always easy in deep-sea diving to find
the oysters. They lie in scattered bunches,
often hidden by sponges, coral or other sea
growths, their gray or moss-grown exteriors
scarcely to be distinguished from the surroundings;
if in mud, only an inch or so of the sharp
lips of the two valves projecting above the
surface are in evidence; while if in stooping to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>gather the shells he should fall, he is likely to
shoot feet foremost to the surface.</p>

<p>Though dress-diving has heretofore been confined
almost entirely to white men, the Japanese,
Chinese, Malays, South Sea Islanders, and
others in different places, are now being educated
to it chiefly through an Australian
fishery.</p>

<p>At the northwestern corner of Australia, a
thousand miles from the nearest railroad and
ten days from the nearest port, there are pearl fisheries
where the climate is so hot that white
men cannot be obtained for the work. Colored
men are shipped there from Singapore to man
the boats, the pearl-fishers giving a bond to the
government of 100 pounds sterling for each man
employed, as a guarantee that he will not go
to other parts of the state. A fleet of about
three hundred boats and fifteen hundred men
are employed there, the supply station being at
Broome township.</p>

<p>In all things, when once the improvements of
science gain a foothold anywhere in the world,
the whole earth succumbs eventually to their
advantages, and so with diving; the habits and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>prejudices of thousands of years will be forced
by commercial pressure to submit themselves
to modern appliances, and the picturesque
nakedness of the swarthy orient will soon be
hidden under the ugly but useful dress of
civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<h2>HABITAT OF THE PEARL OYSTER</h2>


<p>The Pearl Oyster is found in more or less
abundance on the shoals and reefs about the
shores of every land within a belt of the earth
lying between 30 degrees north and south of
the equator. Coral reefs and limestone foundations
usually form the beds on which they
propagate. Beyond these limits the abalone is
found at Japan, on the California coast, Queen
Charlotte's Island, the Cape, Australia, New
Zealand, China, about the English Channel,
and on the coast of France, where the shores are
washed by equatorial currents. It exists also
on the shores of India and the Canary Islands.</p>

<p>The largest and heaviest shells, which yield
fine mother-of-pearl most abundantly are confined
almost entirely to the Pacific Ocean within
twenty degrees south of the equator. The best
white shells come from the northern shores of
Australia and the Aroo islands. The best black
shells are found about Tahiti, the Gambier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>Islands, and the Tuamotu Archipelago. Of
the big yellow variety, the best are obtained in
the Merguian Archipelago and Dutch Indies.
The shells of this district at Ceram, Batjan,
and elsewhere, vary somewhat but the bulk
of them are yellow.</p>

<p>Beginning with the east coast of Africa, the
pearl oyster is found in the Red Sea, where it
has been fished for ages. The shell here is of
medium size and weight; much larger than
those of Venezuela, Ceylon, or the Persian Gulf
and smaller than the shells of the Pacific.
The mother-of-pearl is not of the finest quality
and is used now for inferior work only. It was
more used formerly but since the fresh-water
unio shell of the United States came into the
market, it has displaced to a great degree the
Egyptian and Panama shells. The inner edge
of the Red Sea shell is of a greenish-gray color.</p>

<p>South of the Red Sea, on the East of the
African coast, pearl oysters are found in a
number of places between Zanzibar and Inhambane,
particularly at the Bazaruto Islands, but
nowhere in sufficient abundance to develop the
fishing for them into a regular industry. Good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>mother-of-pearl is abundant on the German East
African coast, but the oysters carry few pearls.</p>

<p>Travelling east, they are next found in large
numbers in that arm of the Arabian Sea known
as the Persian Gulf. Here they have existed
for many centuries. The mollusk is of the
smaller species and the shells are known in the
market as Lingahs, from the name of the centre
of the pearl trade in this district. The shells
are of no commercial importance.</p>

<p>After these come the ancient fisheries of
India, the most prolific in the world. The
oysters here are smaller than those of the
Arabian Sea and the shells are of no value, but
they mature rapidly and yield great quantities
of pearls. Myriads of them cover the shoals and
banks between the coast of India, at the South-eastern
point, and Ceylon, and as the beds are
under government supervision, they cannot be
destroyed by the reckless fishing of immature
oysters.</p>

<p>Crossing the Bay of Bengal and the Malay
Peninsula, between longitudes 100 and 120
degrees E., there are pearl oysters on the coasts
of China, the Merguian Archipelago and western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>Australia. Between longitudes 120 degrees E.
and 150 degrees E., these mollusks flourish on
many coasts, including those of Japan, the Sulu
Archipelago, the Dutch Indies, the Spice
Islands, the Banda Islands, the Aroo Islands,
New Guinea and northern Australia.</p>

<p>The Australian shells are large and the lining
is white and fine. As shell fisheries they are
the largest in the world and although the value
of the pearls found is small compared with the
amount realized from the sale of the shells it is
considerable and growing. The Aroo shells are
white like the Australian. Those from the
Banda Islands are a smaller black-edge shell.
Most of the others like the Manila shell of the
Sulu Islands, are yellow.</p>

<p>At longitude 165 degrees E. the fisheries of
New Caledonia are becoming notable for the
number of fine fancy colored pearls found there.
Both avicula margaritifera and meleagrina
margaritifera are taken off the west coast.</p>

<p>In the waters of the Fiji Islands, longitude
180 degrees E. pearl oysters of the black-edge
shell variety similar to the Bandas but a little
larger are fairly abundant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>Fine shells, often containing very beautiful
pearls, are taken off the coasts of Tahiti,
Gambier, and throughout the Tuamotu Archipelago,
lying between longitudes 130 degrees
W. and 150 degrees W. The shells are of the
black-edge type, large and heavy. The nacre
is thick and has a particularly mellow luster;
throughout this section both shells and pearls
rank among the best.</p>

<p>All over the South Sea, pearl oysters are
found about the islands and in the lagoons
within the atolls which stud it, but in quantities
too small in many places to induce capital to
establish fisheries. Fishing for them is confined
therefore to native divers who are rewarded by
the occasional find of a few pearls, which often
they sell at ridiculous prices to the stray traders
who may chance to come their way.</p>

<p>This eastward journey now brings us to the
Pacific coast of the American continent. Here
the pearl-bearing mollusk is found on the shores
of Lower California, about the Islands of the
Gulf of California, at various points on the
Mexican coast-line south to Acapulco and at
Panama. They exist also on the coast of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>Ecuador but of late years fishing has not proved
remunerative and it is now carried on in a
desultory way only. They are found also on
the western coast of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The Mexican shells known as Panama shell
or bullock shell have a dark, dirty, greenish rim
and are much less valuable than the white or
black shell. Similarly, dark, slaty-colored
pearls are known as Panamas because many
pearls taken on this coast are of that character.
This color tendency however often results more
advantageously as many of the pearls are
sufficiently dark to be classed as fancy and some
beautiful black and red pearls are found in
these waters. Panama pearls also have the
reputation of being softer than others. There
are pearl oysters also on the Peruvian coast but
this section has not yet been fished.</p>

<p>On the Atlantic side of America pearl oysters
are abundant in the Gulf of Campeche and on
the shoals about the islands and shores of
Venezuela. The shells of Central America are
similar to the Panamas only more yellow, while
those of Venezuela are small and valueless.
Between the east coast of America and the Red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>Sea are no fisheries save at Haiti, for no discoveries
of any importance have been made on
the western coast of Africa.</p>

<p>Consideration of these homes of the pearl
oyster shows it to be a tropical fish and that it
attains greater dimensions in the Pacific Ocean
and near the equator than elsewhere. Beyond
30 degrees north it is found only at two points,
the western shore of America and on the Japanese
coast. These shores are washed by equatorial
currents. The small varieties of the
Indian seas and Venezuela, mature rapidly in
four to six years, and if not taken they die out
after the seventh year. The meleagrina of the
Pacific however, though it attains its full size
in six to eight years, continues to lay on shell-nacre
up to twelve and even twenty years.
A shell which is of good size but comparatively
thin is called by the dealers in mother-of-pearl
a "young shell." The Australian pictured at
page 129 is such an one. The Tuamotu at
page 127 is not full grown but well along in
years, probably fourteen to sixteen years old.</p>

<p>Of the sea mollusks yielding formations
which, though not true pearls, are so called,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>(Strombus gigas), is a native of the West Indies.
Another, a gasteropod, the ear-shell (Haliotis)
known in the United States as the abalone, is
found on the coasts of California, Japan, the
English Channel Islands and elsewhere. The
Californians are divided into three classes, the
blue backs, about six inches long, and green and
red-ears, which are half as large again. Pinnas
yielding black seed-pearls are found south of
the Island of Mafia on the east coast of Africa.
On the banks and shoals between Mafia and
Zanzibar is a red mussel from which white
pearls are taken.</p>

<p>The fresh-water pearl-bearing mussel, the
unio, unlike the sea oyster is most abundant
north of 30 degrees N. In China and the
Hawaiian Island Oahu it is found a little to the
south of 30 degrees N., and it has been discovered
lately in Southern Rhodesia a little
north of 30 degrees S., but the countries and
streams in which the unio is plentiful and where
it yields the most pearls lie within latitudes
30 degrees N. and 60 degrees N. They have
been taken from the streams of Great Britain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>since the times when the Romans had a colony
here. They exist in Bohemia, Saxony, Bavaria,
Lapland, Canada, Labrador and in great quantities
in the United States.</p>

<h2>PEARL FISHERIES </h2>


<p>The pearl fisheries of the Red Sea are at
Lohia. At the lower end of the Red Sea, at
Massawa on the African side, and at Lohia on
the Arabian side, are a number of small barren
islands; the banks lie in shallow water between
them. The industry is financed by merchants,
principally natives of Bombay, India, who in
partnership with the Bedouin boat-owners,
control the fishing. The Bedouin captain takes
with him a few Arabs to man the boat and a
number of black slaves as divers. The shells
have a market value for mother-of-pearl but
the quality is inferior. They have a greenish-gray
edge and are fairly heavy and formerly
they were much in demand.</p>

<p>Of late years the fresh-water unio shells have
replaced them to a certain extent for cheap
material but the shells are yet about ninety
per cent. of the value of the fishings. Returns
show exports of pearls averaging one hundred
thousand dollars per annum but as a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>number go direct to Bombay and are not
reported, this does not fairly represent the
extent of the industry.</p>

<p>The beds vary in depth, thirty to forty feet
being the maximum depth fished. Naked
native diving is the rule, but the Italian government
has lately farmed out concessions at
Dahlak and Farsan where they are experimenting
with helmets. The fishing season is from
the beginning of March to the end of May.</p>

<p>The arm of the Arabian sea lying between
Arabia and Persia known as the Persian Gulf,
has always been rich in pearl oysters and is a
prolific source of supply to-day. These banks
are fished chiefly for the pearls. The shell,
though larger than the Ceylon, is of the
"Lingah" class as it is called, and is of little
value for mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>Though pearl oysters are found all along the
coast of Arabia, the most productive shoals are
between the Islands of Halool and Katar.
These shoals commence at the Island of Bahrein
immediately off the Arab coast near the centre
of the gulf and continue east and south along
the district of Katar for nearly two hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>miles after which the banks are lost in deep
water. The chief centre of the pearl trade is
Lingah, hence the name given to the shells of
this district. Most of the pearls go to Bombay
and are known as Bombay pearls, many of
them having a distinctly yellow tint. The
whitest and finest go to Bagdad and eventually
the best go to Europe. India takes the irregular
ones and China gets the seed-pearls.</p>

<p>The principal banks are at Bahrein. This
island is the most important one of a group
situated in an indentation of the Arabian coast
and is about seventy miles long and twenty-five
broad.</p>

<p>Small boats carrying from five to fifteen men
fish the shallows near the coast, but larger boats,
manned by from twenty to fifty men, put out
for the banks further from shore into deep
water. These remain out during the entire
season coming into port once or twice only for
supplies. The owners of the boats are generally
poor. They depend upon the dealers for
advances at the beginning of the season for
supplies, and many of them are therefore
practically in a state of bondage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>When the deep-water boats reach the fishing
grounds, half the crew is selected for diving.
The diver uses a small braided mat basket as a
receptacle for the shells and has a long line
attached to him by which he can signal to the
man in the boat who manages it. There is a
man to each diver's line. Except for the short
intervals at the surface necessary for air and
rest, the divers remain in the water for hours.
The oyster-beds vary in depth from six to
eighteen feet in the shallows, to forty feet at
the banks.</p>

<p>The duration of the fishing season depends
on the temperature of the water. It lasts
usually through July, August, and September,
though some of the larger boats remain out
from the end of June until the beginning of
October.</p>

<p>The pearls are sold by weight, sales being
made sometimes while at sea and a duty
equalling about twenty per cent. is levied on the
spot. A large number of Hindu traders come
during the season to buy, returning to India
at the close as they have done for centuries.</p>

<p>No exact statistics of the output of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>fisheries are to be had but the yield is said to
average well; some authorities placing the
value of the fisheries of the entire district in
the sixties at nearly two millions of dollars per
annum, and the number of boats engaged at
4,000 to 5,000.</p>

<p class="caption">EAST INDIAN PEARL-DIVERS RESTING</p>
</div>

<p>As ancient as those of the Arabian sea and
even more important are the pearl fisheries of
India. These are also fished for the pearls, the
shells of these waters being smaller than those
of the Persian Gulf and valueless for mother-of-pearl.
The pearls however average whiter than
those of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.
Although equally fine pearls are found in other
waters the Ceylon, or Madras pearls as they
are called, have long been esteemed the best
because of their good average color and quality.
These banks are situated in the Gulf of Manaar
between the southern point of India and the
island of Ceylon.</p>

<p>On the Madras (India) side the banks are off
Tinnevalli and Madura at Tuticorin. The
Indian revenue realized a profit of Â£13,000
from a fishing here in 1822, and Â£10,000
from another in 1830. Examinations showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>that there were not sufficient oysters for profitable
fishing after that until 1860, when the
government netted Â£20,000, and a fishing the
following year, 1861, was equally successful.
The banks failed in 1862 and there was no
fishery until 1874. Pollution of the water from
the Indian shores has been detrimental to these
banks and they are now of little importance.</p>

<p>On the Ceylon side, the banks lie six to eight
miles off the west shore and a little south of the
island of Manaar. Fishing has been an industry
from early times before history began. There
are records of these fisheries under the kings
of Kandy and later by the Portuguese after
they took possession of Ceylon about 1505, to
1655 when the island passed into the hands of
the Dutch. In old times they were called the
fisheries of Aripo after a fort on the coast. Not
until the English gained control were the
fisheries so managed that definite knowledge of
the results could be obtained.</p>

<p>After the Dutch gave way to the English,
until 1903, these fisheries had yielded a net
income to the government of over Â£1,000,000.
This covered a period of over one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>years, as the British occupied Ceylon in 1796.
In the early years of this period and prior to
that, the fishings, or rights to fish, were sold to
the highest bidders, usually Hindu merchants.
In 1796 the fishing brought Â£60,000. The
year after the British took possession, 1797, it
realized Â£110,000 that amount having been
paid by Candappa Chetty, a native of Jaffna
for the fishery right, and for that of 1798, the
same renter paid Â£140,000.</p>

<p>These fishings, which were prolonged, so
exhausted the banks that the fishery of 1799
yielded but Â£30,000. From 1799 to 1802 the
yearly product ranged from Â£12,000 to Â£55,000.
In 1804 they were leased for Â£120,000 but
from that time on declined so that in 1828
they brought only Â£30,612. There were no
fishings from 1820 to 1827, nor in 1834 and
after 1837, until 1855. The supply failed in
1864 and for several succeeding years, and again
for a decade, after five successful fishings from
1887 to 1891. The average yearly profit up to
1891 was about Â£34,000.</p>

<p>The Ceylon and Madras fisheries are now in
charge of a government officer, who spends a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>part of each year inspecting the various banks
so as to be informed as to the whereabouts of
mature oysters, and the location and progress
of the young and immature. They keep a
record of their condition at different periods,
and regulate the fisheries by permitting fishing
only when they consider the banks to be ripe
for it.</p>

<p>The oysters mature in from four to six years
so that ordinarily a bank may be fished once in
that period, but it sometimes happens that the
young oysters are swept away by violent storms
or crowded out by natural enemies. In 1901
the Ceylon banks were found to be in a bad way,
there were plenty of young oysters but none
full-grown. The government officers could not
account for the condition, and in response to a
report of the facts the government sent Prof.
W. A. Herdman to Ceylon in 1902. He examined
the whole of the bottom of the Gulf of
Manaar and discovered banks on which were
full-grown oysters, so that a fishing was fixed
for the 23rd of February 1903. Weather prevented
commencement until the second of
March, when fishing began and lasted forty-two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
working days until April the fourteenth.
The fishings take place in March and April
because the sea is usually calm at that period.</p>

<p>The banks lie in five to ten fathoms over a
shallow area nearly fifty miles long by twenty
miles broad, opposite Aripo. A steep declivity
on the western edge gives the sea a depth of one
hundred fathoms in a few miles. In the centre
of the southern part of the Gulf of Manaar,
west of the Chilaw pearl-banks, the sea is one
to two thousand fathoms deep.</p>

<p>Of all the paars, or oyster-beds (paar means
rock or hard bottom) the Periya paar is the
largest. It is about eleven nautical miles long
and from one to two miles broad. Situated in
about five to ten fathoms close to the top of
the western slope of the shallows, and running
north and south about twenty miles from land,
it is exposed to the southwest monsoon which
runs up toward the Bay of Bengal for about
six months of the year. The natives call this
the mother-paar, believing that the young
oysters are carried from it to the other paars,
which are thus stocked at its expense.</p>

<p>Between 1880 and 1902 twenty-one examinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
showed that the Periya paar had been
naturally stocked eleven times with enormous
quantities of young oysters, which as regularly
disappeared before they were old enough to
yield a fishing. The most reliable paars are in
the Cheval district and it is probable that the
government, acting on the suggestion of Prof.
Herdman, will hereafter dredge the breeding
Periya paar of its young oysters and plant them
where they will be able to mature. It is estimated
that many millions of millions of oysters
have been lost from this paar during the last
twenty-five years.</p>

<p>A fishing is not only a matter of commercial
importance, but of wide-spread interest among
the natives of Ceylon and India. The romance
of the situation, the hope of gain, the great
gathering of people from many and far-off
countries, the opportunities for barter, the
possibilities of securing priceless gems for little,
and for making money quickly, all appeal to
the oriental mind.</p>

<p>For this they will endure the discomforts of
long and painful journeys and the dangers of
crowded camp life with a recklessness that contrasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
curiously with the wild panics into which
they are sometimes thrown, as for instance in
1889, when the Ceylon fishing collapsed on
account of cholera. In a few hours a fleet of
200 boats disappeared, the camp was burned,
and the multitude gone.</p>

<p>Great precautions are taken by the government
officials in every direction. When they
have decided that there are banks in condition
to be fished, notice of a fishing is advertised.
The following notification of the fishery for
1904 is an illustration.</p>

<p>"Government Notification.</p>

<p>Pearl fishery of 1904.</p>

<p>Notice is hereby given that a pearl fishery
will take place at Marichchikaddi, in the Island
of Ceylon, on or about March 14, 1904.</p>

<p>1. The bank to be fished is the southwest
Cheval Paar which is estimated to contain
13,000,000 oysters.</p>

<p>2. It is notified that the first day's fishing
will take place on the first favorable day after
March 13.</p>

<p>3. Marichchikaddi is on the main land, eight
miles by sea south of Sillavaturai and supplies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>of good water and provisions can be obtained
there.</p>

<p>4. The fishery will be conducted on account
of the Government, and the oysters put up for
sale in such lots as may be deemed expedient.</p>

<p>5. The arrangements of the fishery will be
the same as have been usual on similar occasions.
Persons attending the fishery camp from
India will be permitted to travel to Ceylon by
either of the following routes: (1) Tuticorin
to Colombo or (2) Paumben to Marichchikaddi
and by no other. Arrangements will be made
as at the last fishery, for travellers to proceed
from Paumben direct to the camp. The only
restriction imposed on travellers by the Paumben
route will be inspection by the medical
officers at Paumben.</p>

<p>6. All payments to be made in ready money
in Ceylon currency.</p>

<p>7. Drafts on the banks in Colombo or bills
on the agents of this Government in India, at
ten days sight, will be taken on letters of credit
produced to warrant the drawing of such drafts
or bills.</p>

<p>8. For the convenience of purchasers, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>treasurer at Colombo and the different Government
agents of provinces will be authorized
to receive cash deposits from parties intending
to become purchasers, and receipts of these
officers will be taken in payment of any sums
due on account of the fishery.</p>

<p>9. No deposit will be received for a less sum
than Rs. 250.</p>

<p>By His Excellency's command.</p>

<p>Everard Im Thurm, Colonial Secretary.
Colonial Secretary's Office, Colombo, Feb. 27,
1904."</p>

<p>The sanitary precautions are of the utmost
importance, for a plague stricken Hindu, if he
were dying, would still endeavor to go where he
might "get rich quickly."</p>

<p>As the time draws near, thousands of speculators
and sightseers from farther and nearer
India arrive. Berbers, Arabs, Persians, and
Burmese, mingle with the Singhalese and Tamil
divers. A town of huts to accommodate perhaps
50,000 springs into existence. Steamer
service to Colombo is started, post and telegraph
service is established and sanitary measures put
in force. Conjurors employed by the divers go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>through incantations to preserve them from the
sharks which abound in these waters.</p>

<p>This shark-charming power is believed to be
hereditary and not dependent on the religion
of the conjuror and he can, if ill or absent, convey
the power to a substitute so that it will be
respected by the sharks. To make matters
doubly sure the divers arm themselves with a
short, pointed piece of ironwood. This however
is not their main reliance for a "wise
woman" was able to avert a panic which was
well under way, after one of the divers was
bitten at the Tuticorin fishing of 1890. Excepting
the loss of a limb occasionally not much
damage is done by the sharks, a fact which
sustains the implicit faith of the natives in their
shark-charmers.</p>

<p>When the day set by the Government officials
arrives, the fleet puts to sea after numerous
ceremonies. The boats, which range from ten
to fifteen tons, are grouped in fleets of sixty
to seventy. Beside the divers they are manned
by ten or more sailors, a steersman, and if
possible by a shark-charmer (pillal karras).
The boats leave at midnight in order to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>ready on the banks at sunrise. At the firing of
a signal gun diving commences. A stone of
granite, shaped like a pyramid and weighing
about thirty to forty pounds, is attached
through a hole at the smaller end to the cord
by which the diver is lowered. Some divers
prefer a half-moon stone fastened to the waist.
Above the stone when attached to the line is a
loop for the diver's foot. The divers work in
pairs, one going down and the other remaining
in the boat to attend to the line, and in some
cases exchanging positions as the diver becomes
exhausted. Naked divers stay below fifty to
eighty seconds on an average, though some can
remain under water longer. Each man makes
forty to fifty descents a day and brings up fifteen
to thirty oysters each time. As a rule the
maximum depth in these waters is about forty-two
feet though fishing at twelve and thirteen
fathoms is reported. The divers work from
sunrise to noon, which allowing for shifts gives
each man four hours diving for a day's work.
A gun is fired as a signal for the day's fishing to
cease and the fleet starts at once for shore.
Upon arriving there the oysters are immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>landed by coolies who carry them in baskets,
on their backs, to the "Kottu," or government
stockade. There they are counted and each
boat-load is divided into three equal parts;
Two of these are chosen by officials for the
government and the remaining heap is the
boats' share. Formerly the catch was divided
into four parts of which the government took
three. Of the boats' share the divers get in
some cases two thirds. As soon as the division
is made, those belonging to the boat are quickly
traded or sold to the numerous small speculators
which abound in the camp. Six evenings in
the week the government auctions off the
catch in lots of one thousand.</p>

<p>While each day's catch is being counted the
average run is carefully watched by experts
who judge by the size, weight and general
appearance of the oysters as to the probable
yield of pearls. Opinions so formed are usually
quite correct and bidding at the auctions are
based on them to a great extent. The principal
buyers are from Madras, Bombay, and other
cities on the Coromandel and Malabar coasts
of India, though local speculators buy many.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>The catch runs about one million per day.
In 1903 forty-four million oysters were taken,
but they realized much less than the catch of
1904, when the number was not quite twenty-six
and three-quarter millions, though it netted
the government $350,000; 1905, however, will
be the record year as it is claimed the profits
will reach the large sum of $830,000. These
figures represent the government's share only.</p>

<p>The price realized at these sales varies not
only with the season but from day-to-day. Ten
to fourteen dollars per thousand is a fair average,
though there are days when as much as twenty-four
dollars is realized. Prices have ranged
from $7.50 to $40.00 per thousand in one season.
The net proceeds go to the revenue of Ceylon.</p>

<p>This has been the system under which the
Ceylon fisheries were managed until lately.
For some reason unknown to the public, the
government, after a season of unequalled profit
in 1905, leased the fisheries to a company, the
Pearl Fishers of Ceylon (Limited), for a period
of twenty years from January 1, 1906. The
company is to pay the government $103,333
per annum and is to expend annually upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>improvement of the fishery not less than
$16,666, or more than $50,000, at the discretion
of the government. The expenses of supervision
and protection by the government must
also be borne by the company.</p>

<p>As a result of the first fishery (1906), the
company after setting aside $49,628 for depreciations
and reserve and carrying forward
$77,382, show a profit of $256,960 which affords
dividends of 36 cents on ordinary shares and
18 cents on deferred shares, a remarkably good
beginning. The government revenue from the
fishery of 1905 was $801,882 after the expenses,
$73,510 were deducted; over $111,000 more
than the profit of 1904 which was the most successful
up to that time.</p>

<p>The inspector of pearl-banks anticipated a
good fishery in 1906 but was of the opinion that
after a small fishery in 1907 and probably 1908
the banks would fail for some years as they have
done in the past.</p>

<p>After the pearls are taken from the dead
oysters they are first sorted for size. This is
done by passing them through a series of ten
small brass sieves known as baskets, containing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>from twenty to one thousand holes. The
sieves have twenty, thirty, fifty, eighty, one
hundred, two hundred, four hundred, six
hundred, eight hundred and one thousand
holes respectively. The pearls are then sorted
for color and quality, weighed and valued. As
with all things, really fine pieces are rare, the
great mass being ordinary or poor. Herein lies
the attraction and excitement of the business
for some will find great gems. One may imagine
the keen interest of the swarthy buyer who has
parted with his hoards, hoping to find a "pearl
of great price" when he washes the lustrous
spheres from the putrid mass of decaying fish:
the eager search; the joy when his eye lights
upon a big, white, shining sphere rising up
among the heap of little ones; the growing
exultation as he picks it out and with feverish
interest rolls it about between his fingers to find
it without flaw or blemish, or the keen disappointment
should his inspection show, as it
most frequently does, that it is full of imperfections.</p>

<p>Hovering about are the buyers for the great
Hindu merchants, agents of far-off princes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>Europeans, all watching sharply for great finds
and ready to enter into the combat of wits which
marks an oriental trading.</p>

<p>If one remembers that there are probably
twenty-five thousand traders congregated on
the hot sands of this far-off shore, the fair dame,
whose neck is clasped by a string of these
precious globules, may conjure from their
lustrous skins, scenes as wild and weird as any
fairy tale that set her youth to dreaming.</p>

<p>The pearls are sorted into a number of
grades. Those perfect in sphericity and luster
are called "ani." Anitari meaning "followers"
or "companions," are of the same general
character, but poorer in those important
qualities. Masanku are somewhat irregular in
shape and faulty, especially in luster and color.
The poorest of this class, lacking the essential
qualities, are separated into another grade and
called "kallipu." Next come "kural," double
or twinned, and "pisal," are misshapen or
clustered. Folded or bent pearls are "madanku,"
and what we would call "rejection," a mixed
lot of all sorts and sizes too poor to include in
any of the regular classifications, are termed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>"vadivu." Seed-pearls, the very small pearls of
which there are great quantities, are known as
"tul." Many of these are ground to "chunam"
or shell-lime, and used as an ingredient in a
favorite masticatory.</p>

<p>The assortments being made, they are
weighed and recorded in kalanchu (kalungy)
and manchadi (manjaday). The kalanchu is a
brass weight equal to 67 grains troy, and the
manchadi is a small red berry that is of very
even weight when full sized, and is reckoned
twenty to a kalanchu.</p>

<p>In the valuation of ani, anitari and vadivu,
the individual size, form, and color is considered,
but the others are simply valued by weight.</p>

<p>The modus operandi of these fisheries like
all others managed by Orientals continues much
the same from fishing to fishing. Experiments
have been made at the Tuticorin fishery with
helmeted divers but their catch compared
unfavorably with that of the naked natives,
who will sometimes under favorable circumstances
bring up two thousand in a day. It
is said that the X-ray is being used to some
extent in the examination of shells and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>those found to be without pearls are thrown
back into the sea, but it is doubtful if the general
use would be practical or advantageous while
oysters remain abundant; so far, the use of it
has been experimental only.</p>

<p>Fine pearls are found in Dutch India among
the Molucca Islands. Fishing is done by the
natives, and as they seldom go deeper than ten
or twelve feet the probability is that they do
not get the finest shells or pearls, for it seems to
be quite well established that the shells taken
from deep water are larger and more likely to
contain large pearls. Whether this arises from
deep water being more favorable to growth,
or an unmolested opportunity to grow, has not
been determined.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Netherlands Indian government
has opposed encroachment upon the rights of
the natives and colonists, and has patrolled
the waters with small gunboats to prevent any
attempt by Europeans to fish. But lately concessions
have been made to British firms so that
shell is being shipped direct to London, and
it is now thought that these fisheries will
soon rival the Australian. The pearls were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>formerly bought from natives, principally of
the Island of Aroe, by Chinese and Arabs
who took them to Macassar. From there they
were sent first to Singapore and then to London,
Paris, and Amsterdam. Most of the pearls
brought to Macassar are baroques, though fine
specimens of more regular shape arrive there
occasionally. The mother-of-pearl from these
shells is of good quality.</p>

<p>Some pearls are found at the Bazaruto
Islands, Portuguese East Africa, a few miles
from the coast, midway between Inhambane
and Beira. A concession was granted to a company
about 1892, but bad management, lack
of funds and political difficulties, killed the
enterprise.</p>

<p>General reports indicate that it is very
difficult for any enterprise subject to the officials
of this district to succeed. The Bazaruto
Kaffirs still fish, but without system or intelligence.
They are wasteful and damage many
of the pearls by cooking the oyster. The
few found are shipped by Indian traders to
Bombay and Zanzibar.</p>

<p>Pearl fishing has been attempted on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>coast of German East Africa at Zanzibar Island
and south, between the Island of Mafia and the
main coast. Mother-of-pearl is abundant but
few pearls have been found and there has been
no sustained effort. There are large coral
banks about the islands of the coast favorable
for the growth of mother-of-pearl and there is
shallow water over large areas.</p>

<p>Good white pearls have been taken from a
red mussel found there. South of the Island of
Mafia are beds of large pinna shells which yield
black seed-pearls. There are pearl-shell fisheries
in the Merguian Archipelago and in the government
of Burmah and some pearls are found.
The banks, scattered over an area of eleven
thousand square miles, are rented from the
government and rights to fish are sublet on
royalty. The fishing is nearly all done by
helmeted divers.</p>

<p>Avicula and meleagrina margaritifera are
taken off the west coast of New Caledonia.
From the former large numbers of pearls are
taken, and from the latter, very beautiful white
pearls. Fine colored pearls pink, yellow, gray
and black are often found in this district. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>variety of oyster commonly called shoulder of
mutton, and another shell-fish called jamboneau
(pinna) of which the pearl is very fine, are also
found in these waters.</p>

<p>A syndicate was formed in Paris to exploit
these beds and obtained concessions covering
one hundred and thirty miles. Owing to the
difficulty of getting divers, the waters had not
been exploited to any great depth up to 1898,
the regular fishings being confined to the shallows
of six to seven feet, though larger shells
were known to be in deeper water. More
systematic work with modern appliances and
in deeper waters has since been done with good
success, but late reports show an accumulation
of shell and indications that the industry has
not been profitable.</p>

<p>In 1904 the price of shell (black-edge mother-of-pearl)
fell to $250, U. S. gold per ton of
2240 pounds, from $700, the former price, with
six hundred tons stored in London, Paris, Berlin,
New York and San Francisco, making a prospective
loss of $270,000 for 1904. There was an
attempt to limit the production by a return to
native diving. With dress the output would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>about 500 tons for the year, with naked-diving
200 tons less. This would operate against the
local government, as it not only levies $38.60
U.S. gold per metric ton as an export duty, but
makes a large profit on the diving machines
by way of license. The pearl fisheries of French
Oceanica therefore face a grave situation.</p>

<p>Pearls are found occasionally on the western
coast of Nicaragua at San Juan del Norte. The
Panama coast still yields great quantities of
pearls as it has done for many years. When
Spain controlled the northwestern section of
South America with the Isthmus to the borders
of Guatemala, under the name of Colombia,
immense quantities of pearls were sent home by
the colonists.</p>

<p>It is recorded that 697 pounds of pearls were
imported into Seville from Colombia in 1587.
A large proportion of these undoubtedly came
from the coasts of what is now Venezuela. The
Panama or bullock shell as it is called, is not of
the finest quality and the pearls are apt to be
dark and inferior to the Indian pearls in luster
as well as in color; nevertheless fine pearls are
found there and the fisheries yield a greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>average of black pearls than any other. Beautiful
iridescent pearls are also found there.</p>

<p>The Pearl islands are on the east side of the
Bay of Panama about forty miles from the city.
The banks there may only be fished by divers
but between Chiriqui and Veragua dredging is
allowed. Since the United States government
has become interested in this section there is a
tendency here to exploit the Panama coasts
and companies have been formed in the States
for that purpose. The pearl fisheries formerly
carried on along the coast of Ecuador about two
hundred miles north of Guayaquil, are no longer
operated.</p>

<p>On the Atlantic coast of South America the
most fruitful pearl-banks lie along the coast of
Venezuela and west to Rio Hacha on the
Colombian coast. This was the first part of the
American mainland sighted by Columbus and
the quantities of pearls owned by the natives
did much to draw the tide of adventurers which
set this way in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The oysters are taken from reefs and bars
about one mile from shore and about the
islands. The principal beds are at El Tirano,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>north-east, and Macanao, north-west of the
island of Margarita. There are fisheries also at
the neighboring Islands of Coche and Cubagua.
About four hundred sail-boats of from three to
fifteen tons, employing two thousand men, are
constantly at work in these fisheries.</p>

<p>A French company purchased a concession
about the year 1900 from a Venezuelan to fish
in this neighborhood. It was to pay the
Venezuelan government 10 per cent. of the profits
as royalty and use divers and diving apparatus
so as to select the oysters and avoid waste
of the immature. Fishing by natives is done
mostly by dredging with metal scoops. It is estimated
that upwards of $600,000 worth of pearls
are found about the island of Margarita per
annum, most of them going to the Paris market.</p>

<p>Exclusive rights have been granted a Venezuelan
citizen by the local government lately
to exploit the Gulf of Cariaco for pearls and
other sea products. The contract is for twenty-five
years. Certain advantages are guaranteed
by the government which is to receive fifteen
per cent. of the net profits of the enterprise.</p>

<p>About forty or fifty years ago several English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>companies conducted profitable fisheries in the
lower Gulf of Maracaibo and on the coasts of
the Goajira territory and Paraguana. They
employed Indians as divers. Revolutionary
troubles during the last twenty-five years so
demoralized the Indians, that the industry was
finally broken up. Reports from authoritative
sources indicate, that not only could paying
fisheries be established here, but that the
interior is rich in minerals and precious stones.</p>

<p>Until lately there have been few restrictions
upon fishing along the Venezuelan coast beyond
a tax of fifty dollars imposed by local authorities
upon the buyers and the payment of fifteen
bolivars ($2.90) by each boat for a fishing permit
at Margarita.</p>

<p>The oysters of this coast mature rapidly and
like those of Ceylon live but six or seven years.
They are small and the shells are so thin that
they can be crushed between the fingers. They
are of the Lingah type and are named by some
avicula squamulosa. The nacreous lining is
also very thin, but lustrous and beautifully
iridescent. The pearls run small and very many
of them are quite yellow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<p>Many fine white pearls are found however,
though they incline frequently to a waxy
luster and are often marred by chalky spots.
Great quantities of baroques, notably beautiful
for color and orient, are found. Round pearls
with a china-like skin in many colors are also
quite common. The average size and quality
is not equal to those of the Indian waters,
though it is much better than is generally
credited, as the traders in this country for some
inexplicable reason have an idea that Venezuelan
pearls are necessarily poorer than
others.</p>

<p>This notion has probably been fostered among
American buyers by the Parisian dealers who
at present well nigh control the output of these
fisheries and naturally fear the diversion to a
neighboring market which now pays a heavy
toll to Paris on pearls taken from this continent.
It is true an unusually large percentage of
cracked pearls is found among Venezuelans,
and they lose perceptibly in weight after being
brought from the fisheries the loss averaging
fully one-eighth of one per cent., nevertheless
many pearls of the finest quality are taken from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>these fisheries. All pearls are subject to slight
variations in weight.</p>

<p>It was from the fisheries of Colombia that
Philip <abbr title="2">II</abbr>. of Spain received the large pearl of
250 carats, about the size and shape of a
pigeon's egg, so often mentioned in the chronicles
of precious stones.</p>

<p>The management of the pearl fisheries of the
Colombia of to-day is in the hands of the central
bank of Colombia which is empowered to
transact business pertaining to property belonging
to the government. This institution holds a
public auction and awards the lease of the rights
to fish for pearls, coral, etc., on the Colombian
coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, to
the most desirable bidder. The lessee must be
governed by the rules and regulations laid
down by the bank. The lease is for five years
and went into effect August 1st, 1906.</p>

<p>New pearl oyster-beds were discovered in
1903 in the Gulf of CampÃ¨che near Coatzacoalcos
and application was made by a Mexican
to the Mexican government for a concession to
work them. There are extensive beds, which
are constantly fished, along the eastern coast of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>Lower California from its junction with the
United States to Cape San Lucas. La Paz is
the principal centre of the fisheries. An English
syndicate has a concession from the Mexican
government which was lately renewed, for
fishing about La Paz. Pearls worth $350,000,
among them many fine black pearls, and five
thousand tons of shells valued at $1,250,000,
were taken in 1904. This syndicate employs
all the modern appliances.</p>

<p>Beds are known and worked from La Paz
to and about the island of Loreto on the east
coast, and at the island of Tiburon over on
the East side of the gulf, and from Mazatlan
all along the coast of Mexico proper to the
boundary line of Guatemala. These beds were
discovered by Cortez in 1536 and were worked
spasmodically for two centuries; then for a
period they were fished so constantly and
thoroughly that the market was over-loaded
with pearls and the supply of oysters seriously
diminished. Of late years fishing has been again
carried on systematically and with sufficient
judgment to prevent the immediate destruction
of the beds as before.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>
<p>A pearl oyster-bed ten miles long has lately
been located at the Punta de Santa Cristoval.
The Mexican season for fishing varies in localities
from May to November, or June to December.
The day's work of the diver commences at
near the ebb tide and ends shortly after the
beginning of the flood tide, about three hours
in all. Much fishing is done by independent
naked native divers, in a manner similar to
that of the Hindus and Arabs, but some of the
large concessionaires supply their divers with
helmets and other modern appliances.</p>

<p>Schooners of various sizes having several
boats, carry the fishing parties to the banks
and the men live on them through the entire
season. The daily catches are delivered to an
armed boat which carries the oysters ashore,
where they are at once searched for pearls.
These when found are immediately sorted and
valued, a percentage going to the diver in
addition to his wages, if he is a regular employee
of the Company.</p>

<p>The oysters are found adhering to rocks by
the byssus, generally in bunches, hinge-side
down, curved side up and the shells slightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>parted. The diver cuts them loose with a knife
and deposits them in his basket or net. One
hundred to a hundred and fifty is a good day's
work for a naked diver, but with the appliances
now being introduced, a diver in dress can raise
fully double that number. It should be remembered
that there are elements of uncertainty and
irregularity in the catch of the meleagrina. As
compared with the enormous and crowded beds
of the small varieties as they exist in the Gulf
of Manaar and at the island of Margarita,
Venezuela, where they can be literally scooped
up, the scattered bunches of the meleagrina do
not afford easy data for reckoning averages.</p>

<p>On the coasts of China, Japan, Korea, some
of the South Sea Islands, the English Channel
islands, the Canary islands, about <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Malo on
the coast of France, at Queen Charlotte's island
and along the coast of California from north
of San Francisco to the border of Lower
California, at the Cape of Good Hope, India,
Australia and New Zealand, a shell-fish is taken
which has considerable commercial value and
yields pearls to a limited extent.</p>

<p>It is called in this country abalone. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>Channel islands it is known as the ormer. It
is the Haliotis or Ear-shell. The Greeks called it
venus ear-shell and used it as a food, considering
it most nutritious. Old English writers praised
it as a delicious morsel under the name of
ormond saying that it was bigger and infinitely
better than the oyster. This shell-fish attaches
itself to the rocks by a flat, disk-shaped foot
and must be taken when the tide is low. The
fisherman can then insert a knife by stealth
under the foot and taking the fish unawares,
destroy the suction. Otherwise the hold of the
fish could not be broken without destroying
the shell. New Zealanders call the fish itself
the mutton fish.</p>

<p>The Japanese, Chinese and Indians of the
Pacific coast have long used it as an article of
food. The shells are valuable on account of the
very beautiful nacreous lining which is exceptionally
good material for buttons and various
ornamental purposes. The lining has an
exquisite play of colors in the richest tones of
peacock greens and reds. There are about
seventy species of the Haliotis and the shells
vary greatly in size. The British ormer (H.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>tuberculata) is of small size, about six inches
long and is silvery. The shells are sometimes
called in trade aurora shells. After being well
beaten to make them tender the animals are
used for food.</p>

<p>The ormer or auris marina was esteemed by
the ancients as a very sweet and luscious dish.
The people of the Channel islands ornament
their houses with the shells and farmers use
them to frighten the birds from their corn-fields.
They string several together and suspend them
from the end of a slender pole stuck in the
ground. The wind swaying them, makes a
constant clatter. The Haliotis iris of New
Zealand is green and brilliantly iridescent. A
Cape of Good Hope species (H. Mida), under the
epidermis is tinged with color, principally
orange.</p>

<p>Some of the more beautiful species were
formerly very abundant on the coasts of China
and Japan, but the constant use of the animal
for many years as a food stuff has made them
less common there and the Chinese and Japanese
now obtain a large part of their supply from
California, where the haliotis or abalone, as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>is called is taken in great quantities. The two
most beautiful species found on this coast are,
the Haliotis splendens, a magnificent shell of
rainbow coloring in which peacock green predominates,
and H. rufescens, the lining of which
is red. When found, the latter is usually
thickly incrusted and coated with vegetation.
The green and red range from seven to ten
inches, the latter being generally the larger.</p>

<p>Another variety, H. cracherodii, very dark
green or black without, and with no apparent
beauty, has a small opalescent bit inside the
shell which is cut out and made into articles of
jewelry. This is common in crevices of rocks.
A variety called bluebacks has a bright clayey
blue exterior. The Indians of the Pacific coast
have used these shells as material for jewelry
and decoration for centuries, but not until the
button-makers of Europe and New York began
to utilize them did they become an item of
importance among the exports of the Pacific
coast.</p>

<p>Few pearls are found in the abalone but they
yield a considerable number of large rounded
baroques and excrescences, rich and beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>in color and of fair luster, also odd-shaped
pieces like blisters matched and joined at the
edges. The greens have a bronze appearance
and the reds and pinks are often iridescent.
Quite a number of good "peelers" are found
among them. These are pearly formations
which can be improved by taking off one or
more of the outer skins.</p>

<p>Pearl-fishing, principally by Greeks, has been
carried on about the west and south coast of
Haiti, but lately the government has granted a
concession to four of its citizens covering nine
years with the privilege of renewal at the end
of that period. This will prohibit all others
from fishing unless they rent the privilege from
the concessionaires.</p>

<p>To the south of the Philippines, pearl fisheries
were worked by the natives before the
arrival of the Spaniards, and the industry is
still carried on, chiefly by antiquated methods.
The coasts of the Sulu islands, at Jolo and elsewhere
and about the island of Mindanao, have
yielded many fine pearls and continue to do so.
The shells from these waters furnish very fine
mother-of-pearl.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>
<p>All things considered, the largest and best
equipped fisheries in the world to-day are those
on the coast of Australia. Not as many pearls
are found as at Ceylon. The main object of
fishing is the shell, which is large, heavy, and
furnishes the best quality of mother-of-pearl of
the white variety. From Charlotte's Bay on
the north-eastern coast, all along the northern
coast and around to Exmouth Gulf on the
western coast, pearl oysters are abundant.
Farther south at Sharks Bay, the oysters are
smaller and the pearls, though of good shape
and luster, run yellow. Shells from the coast of
Queensland are sold as Sydney shell; those from
the northern territory of South Australia, as
Port Darwin shell, and from there to Exmouth
Gulf on the western coast, they are marketed
as West Australian shell.</p>

<p>The fishing is carried on by organized companies
having capital, and every modern
appliance of practical value is utilized. The
divers fish with the dress. The usual method
of fishing is for a schooner of eighty to one
hundred tons to put out with a number of
luggers of from eight to ten tons. Each lugger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>is manned by a captain, a cook, one man at the
life-line, two men at the air-pumps and one
diver. Each lugger will average half a ton of
shells per month ranging from 1600 to 2000
to the ton. The pearls like the shells run white.</p>

<p>The Australians are not only pushing this
industry along their own coast, but are extending
operations along the islands north toward
the equator, wherever it is possible. And
wherever they go they carry with them the best
modern appliances and methods. Lately however
operations have been considerably curtailed
in the Torres straits owing to the enforcement
of laws for the protection of divers.</p>

<p>Lack of men for diving caused some of the
operators to use questionable means to obtain a
supply. Boats were sent through the South Sea
among the islands and aborigines, Chinese,
and even European sailors, were kidnapped and
held in practical slavery. Many lives have been
lost in these fisheries and the evils connected
with the industry became so notorious that the
government took action. It is probable that
the business will be reorganized and either
conducted by the state or under government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>supervision. Natives are now being trained
to use the dress.</p>

<p>Few pearls are found and it not infrequently
happens that as many as fifteen to twenty tons
of shells are raised without finding a single
pearl of value. At this time shells from these
fisheries bring from $500 to $750 per ton in the
New York market. Helmets have been used
to some extent throughout the Pacific for a
number of years, but many were crude affairs,
carelessly managed and the loss of life was as
great as by naked-diving. The training of the
natives to the use of the more modern appliances
will however engender confidence and the
probability is that dress-diving will become
general in the south seas wherever the industry
is organized.</p>

<p>As a rule the largest oysters and pearls, where
there is a calcareous foundation for the bed, are
taken from the deeper waters, and it is probable
that as modern appliances are more generally
used by the larger organizations now taking hold
of the industry, the fisheries will be extended
with good results in many localities to waters
beyond the shallows now fished. More systematic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
methods will prevent waste and the
destruction of the beds.</p>

<p>The English Colonial governments of India
are doing much in this direction. By keeping
experts upon the ground, they have learned
how to fish without destroying the beds, and
to fish when it is possible for the oysters to
contain pearls. Strict supervision and protection
of the beds result in more frequent fishings
and greater returns to both the government
and the fishermen.</p>

<p>This example is being followed, and pearl
fisheries are gradually coming either under
governmental supervision or into the hands of
concessionaires, whose large investment makes
the preservation of the beds a business necessity,
whether they fish mainly for pearls or
shells.</p>

<p>The best pearls and the largest number are
found usually in mature shells which are distorted;
it has been stated as a possibility, that
in the future some of the new rays will be used
in fisheries where the pearl is the main object
of the fisher, to ascertain if the oyster contains
any before destroying it. M. Dubois of Lyons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>has experimented with Roentgen rays for that
purpose.</p>

<p>As the fish is enormously prolific it is more
probable however that effort will be directed
instead toward the preservation of the mollusk
from the enemies and accidents which are
occasionally greater than its productiveness.</p>

<p>One of the greatest dangers in Indian waters
to a bed of young oysters is a little mollusk
known locally in Ceylon as suran (Modiola).
These cluster in masses on the sea bottom
and spreading over the surface of the coral,
crowd out the delicate young of oysters
recently deposited.</p>

<p>The Japanese fisheries suffer from the occasional
infection of the waters by a weed,
dinoflagellata gonyaulax. It accumulates in
immense quantities, causing a wide discoloration
of the sea water and is very destructive to
an oyster-bed. It is called the red current or
red tide. So far no preventive or remedy has
been found.</p>

<p>Hitherto the most general and fatal danger to
oyster-beds has been the ungoverned extravagance
of irresponsible fishers who seek to harvest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>in the present regardless of the future, but these
are gradually being made amenable to restrictive
laws as authorities awake to the value of
the industry. A greater danger which threatens
the unio of American streams, is the pollution
of the water by the discharge of the refuse of
factories and the sewage of cities into them. A
mussel bed will recover in time when denuded
by fishers, but sewage and poison kills it out
entirely.</p>

<p>Although fresh-water pearl-bearing mussels
are found in the streams of many countries,
only in the United States are they taken in
sufficient quantities to make the fishings
important as an industry. They are to be found
throughout the Mississippi drainage area and
in part of that of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence. Few exist
on the Pacific coast and those of the Atlantic
coast are generally inferior as pearl-mussels.
There are many varieties of the unio which
yield pearls. Latin names are given by different
writers to distinguish them, but as scientists
differ in their classifications, the names are not
always uniform and are not sufficiently well
established to be useful, descriptively, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>general reader. In treating of the various kinds
of pearl-bearing unios of the United States
therefore in these pages, the common names by
which they are known will as a rule be used with
the scientific names appended, as revised by
the department of mollusks of the United States
National Museum.</p>

<p>From the times of Roman colonization until
now, pearls have been taken from the mussels
of British streams. There are three varieties
of pearl-bearing mussels in Great Britain:
Painter's mussel (U. pictorum), the Swollen
River mussel (U. tumidus) and the Pearl
mussel (U. margaritifera).</p>

<p>The first two occur only in the streams and
ponds of England and Wales and the pearls
found in them are of inferior quality. The
latter inhabits the streams of Scotland and the
northern counties of England and to some extent
are found in Ireland and Wales also. The shell
is oblong, rather flat and heavy and about five
and one-half inches long. The exterior surface
is rough, and blackish-brown; the pearly
interior has a tint of flesh color mottled by
stains of dull green. It was from this variety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>the Perthshire Tay pearls were taken, which
gained so much notoriety in the middle of the
eighteenth century when some fifty thousand
dollars worth were sent to London from this
stream in three years.</p>

<p>Scotch pearl-fishing was revived in 1860 and
some fine ones were sold to Queen Victoria,
the Empress of the French, the Duchess of
Hamilton and others. Pearl-mussels have been
found in Lochs Rannoch, Tay, Lubnaig and
Earn, also in the Don, the Leith and other
streams. Some are found in the Welsh streams,
and the river Bann in Ireland was noted for
the fine pearls found in it. Many years ago
there was a pearl fishery at Omagh in the north
of Ireland. An old writer claims that CÃ¦sar
obtained pearls of such bigness in Britain that
he tried the weight of them by his hand.</p>

<p>The fishers wade for them in shallow pools,
or thrust sticks between the open valves, or
drag branches over them, for as soon as anything
enters between the two shells they close
upon it at once. The mussels are found generally
set up in the sand of the river-bed with
the open side, if the current is very strong,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>turned away from it. The custom of the
peasantry is to fish for them in the autumn after
harvest.</p>

<p>Pearl-mussels are found also in Saxony,
Bavaria, Bohemia, Mesopotamia, Lapland,
Canada, Labrador, the Hawaiian Island Oahu,
Japan (especially the anodonta japonica),
China, the United States and Italy, in the
Gwaai and Shangani rivers of Southern
Rhodesia, South Africa. Nowhere are they
found however in such quantities or in so many
varieties as in the United States. The number
taken from the streams here of late years has
been so great that the shells have largely displaced
the marine Egyptian and have affected
the demand for the better qualities of South
Sea mother-of-pearl. The pearls found in them
also have been of such quality and quantity
that they now have an important place among
the jewels of the world.</p>

<p>Old records and the contents of Indian
mounds show that the unio was taken from the
rivers by the aborigines for the pearls they
sometimes contained; but no wide interest in
this possible wealth of the rivers appears to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>have developed among their white successors
until the finding in 1857 of a large pearl weighing
ninety-three grains at Notch Brook near
Paterson, N. J. It was afterwards sold to the
Empress EugÃ©nie of France for $2500. This
became noised abroad and immediately multitudes
began to search for pearls.</p>

<p>Mussels were gathered and destroyed by the
million, few pearls being found. The excitement
subsided as the searchers learned how
few got adequate reward for their time and
labor. They soon began to realize that the
finding of a pearl of value is usually preceded
by the opening of hundreds or thousands of
shells containing none, and that in the aggregate,
the shells thrown away were worth more
than the few pearls found.</p>

<p>Another pearl hunt developed along the
Little Miami River in Ohio from the finding of
several fine pearls near Waynesville in 1876.
This reached its height in 1878. In 1880, pearls
began to come into the New York market from
the West and South. Immense beds have been
fished in the White, Wabash and Ohio Rivers
in Indiana. In the summer of 1889 a number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>of fine pearls were found in the south-western
corner of Wisconsin, in Crawford, Grant,
Lafayette and Green counties. Not only were
they notable for extraordinary luster, but many
were of beautiful color. The sale of some at
prices which seemed fabulous to the people of
that section, when it became generally known,
caused such a scramble for them by the natives
that the streams were rapidly denuded of
mussels, and that section has become of much
less importance than others since developed.
Prairie du Chien is the center of the Wisconsin
market, from which point the shells are distributed
to the button factories.</p>

<p>The following year (1890) pearl-bearing
mussels were found in several of the central
counties of Illinoisâ€”McLean, Tazewell and
Woodford, in the Mackinaw river and tributaries,
but no discovery equalling that of Wisconsin
occurred until 1897 when the Arkansas
beds were discovered. A peculiarity of this
district is that whereas the unio is usually
most abundant in swift clear water having a
sandy or gravelly bottom, many are found
here in the mud.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>
<p>They have been taken over a wide territory
from the rivers and streams of the eastern half
of the state, including the Black, White, Cache,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis, Ouachita, Saline and Dorcheat
rivers, and in the valley of the Arkansas. Following
this were finds in Indian Territory,
Missouri, Georgia and Tennessee, the latter being
the most prolific. The finest pearls in Tennessee
are found in the fluter, or lake shell, which is
the same as the mussel known on the Wabash
as the wash-board. A yellow shell is found in
the Clinch River similar to the mucket of
Arkansas, from which pearls are taken.</p>

<p>Unlike the pearl oyster, the unio seems to be
more prolific of pearls in the shallows and
riffles near the edges of the rivers. Most of the
fine pearls are found between the pallial line
and the lip in the free portion of the mantle.
Those found within the pallial line, where the
mantle is attached to the shell, are seldom as
lustrous or perfect.</p>

<p>Pearls are found in many States besides those
mentioned, but the fishing is done quietly and
in some cases the sources of supply are known
to only a few who in the marketing of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>pearls carefully avoid giving any information.
This is particularly true of some of the eastern
states. Streams in the Northwestern section
of New York State are regularly fished, but
without excitement. The large fisheries of the
Mississippi and West are fished principally for
the mother-of-pearl in the shells. As with some
of the marine fisheries, the pearl is regarded
as an extra.</p>

<p>The mussels are taken in various ways. In
Canada, boats drag brush and the branches of
trees over the river bottoms, gathering the
mussels into the boat as the twigs become
clogged. In the large beds often found in our
Western Rivers, fishing is done wherever
possible by dredging. Metal scoops, hand,
shoulder and scissor-rakes are used and the
mollusks, taken in immense quantities are
cooked to open them, then cleaned of the meat
which is afterwards examined for pearls. This
method is used where the mussels lie in great
masses or on sandy bottoms. Where there
are boulders or large stones, a great number
of hooks are dragged over the beds.</p>

<p>The mussels, partially buried, lie lip-end up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>and the shell slightly parted. Should anything
come within this gaping aperture, the mussel
at once closes upon it, nipping on with such
tenacity that the hold is not loosed until the
fisher draws it into the boat and forcibly
releases the hook. It is said the mollusk's shell
would remain thus tightly closed for ten or
twelve hours. After dragging the hooks over
the bed, the mussels are taken off and the process
repeated.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="i_262" name="i_262"><img src="images/i_262.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="378" /></a>
<p class="caption">PEARL-FISHING IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER</p>
</div>

<p>Various rough devices are used, the principle
in all being the same. One, illustrative, consists
of a piece of lead pipe or an iron bar
several feet long, from which depend a number
of double or triple hooks several inches apart.
This is dropped overboard, the rope on which it
is hung is fastened to the stern of the boat, and
the boatman rows over the mussel bed dragging
it after him. Men who dredge for the mollusks
are called clammers. Pearlers are those who
at odd times fish for the mussels with pearls as
the main object. This class is composed of the
backwoods natives who live about the streams
in which the mussels are found. They are
people who usually follow their inclinations as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>nearly as they can, working only as it becomes
requisite to obtain the few coarse necessities
of their lives. With them also are small farmers
who at seasons when farm work is not pressing,
seek the excitement and possible profit of the
hunt for pearls.</p>

<p>For all such persons the occupation has a
great fascination. The difficulties of following
the streams through almost impenetrable surroundings,
the coarse fare of bacon, meal and
coffee; the long tramps back and forth to
their mountain huts, or the exposure to night
in the tangle of the woods, have no terrors for
them; they are but common experiences.</p>

<p>Few pearls of value are found, but the occasional
pearl which each one does get, makes
expectation tingle, and hope recounts again
and again the great finds which others have
made. There are curious happenings which
illustrate the uncertainties of the work.</p>

<p>It is told on the Clinch river in East Tennessee
that a pearler, having patiently fished all day,
examining the fish from time to time as little
heaps of them were gathered, without finding
even a small pearl, finally decided to quit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>He was about to examine his last small heap
when a man standing by offered him fifty cents
for the lot. The offer was accepted. From the
first shell opened, the buyer extracted a ball
pearl which was afterwards sold for one thousand
dollars. Two of the finest pearls taken
one season from the same section were obtained
from a heel-splitter, carelessly dug out of the
sand by a man wading in the shallows of the
river. The heel-splitter is a large thin-shelled
variety, so named by the natives because of
the sharp, cutting quality of the shell which
protrudes from the sand of the river. They
rarely contain pearls, but when they do, the
pearls are usually fine.</p>

<p>The largest proportion of fine pearls to the
yield of any section since discoveries have been
recorded, came from Wisconsin, and many of
the best of these, especially of the fancy colored
ones, were taken from Sugar river. Many of
these were exceptionally beautiful in both color
and luster and a good proportion of them were
also round.</p>

<p>Much is written and told of the marvellous
pearls found in our streams worth large sums
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>of money. Such pearls are found undoubtedly
but not in such quantities as one might think
from the enthusiastic reports current in daily
papers. Finds are written up by reporters who
know nothing of pearls and prefer to write a
readable story of wondrous gems and great
values to a statement of plain unvarnished
facts. In this the news-gatherer is assisted by
some simple native with an eye single to a good
price and a capacity for exaggerated ideas of
value impossible to Maiden Lane.</p>

<p>It is no uncommon trick when buyers are
present, to find again, a pearl, which has been
to New York and back and the ruse often succeeds.
Pearls are frequently sold at the fisheries
for much more than they would bring in the
east. In fact it is difficult to buy ordinary
pearls at a reasonable price. The natives
will sometimes sell a really fine pearl for less
than it is worth because they do not understand
the relative values of quality; but they usually
over-estimate pieces of poor quality.</p>

<p>A large majority of those found in our fresh-water
mussels fail in some essential quality.
Many are chalky, or lustrous at one or two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>points only. Others are faulty in shape, or if
spherical, deeply pitted. Really fine pieces are
usually small or button, and when large, are
baroques. Some of the latter are magnificent.
Weighing fifty to over one hundred grains, with
skins of extraordinary luster and iridescence;
white, or of a beautiful pink tint, these strawberry
or rose pearls, as they are called, frequently
excel, by every standard of beauty,
the imperfect spheres which command a greater
price in the market because they are round.</p>

<p>The most common variety of unio in American
rivers, especially in the Mississippi river, is
that known as the nigger-head (Quadrula
ebena). It is also the principal species used
for button-making.</p>

<p>Similar is the warty-back (Quadrula pustulosa)
so called because the shell has a number
of warts or excrescences on the outside of the
valves. The "bull-head" (Pleurobena Aesopus)
is found in abundance with the nigger-head.
It has a blackish-brown exterior, presenting
several radiating ridges, and a white lining.
The two latter are inferior as material for
buttons as the shells are brittle. The mucket
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>(Lampsilis ligamentinus) is a large shell, average
size 4 inches, has a dark brown exterior
and cream-white lining. It is too thin and
brittle to make first class material for buttons
though fine pearls are sometimes found in
them.</p>

<p>The sand-shells furnish good material for
buttons. They are long, sometimes six inches,
and narrow. They are usually found on sandy
bottoms and are said to move from the channel
toward the shores in the morning and back in
the evening. The most abundant is the yellow
sand-shell (Lampsilis anodontoides) so called
from its bright yellowish brown exterior.
Another kind, the black sand-shell (Lampsilis
rectus) has a black epidermis. A smaller
variety, less abundant now than formerly, is
the slough sand-shell (Lampsilis fallaciosus).
These are generally found in coves or the mouths
of rivulets.</p>

<p>The deer-horn or buckhorn (Tritigonia verrucosa)
is a large variety, sometimes attaining
a length of nine inches in the Iowa river, though
the average in the Mississippi is about five
inches. The shell, as the name indicates, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>a rough, warty exterior. The supply is small
and uncertain.</p>

<p>Another rare species is the butterfly (Plagiola
securis). It is a small, flat, thick shell of fine
color, and the valves are butterfly in shape
with a reddish-brown epidermis striped by
darker radiating lines. It is abundant only in
the Illinois and Ohio rivers.</p>

<p>The hatchet-back, hackle-back, or heel-splitter
(Symphynota complanata), is a large
black mussel having a thin sharp-edged shell,
one valve-edge projecting. It yields few pearls
though fine specimens are occasionally found in
this variety.</p>

<p>The blue-point (Quadrula undulata) has a
large, thick shell, with ridges on the exterior,
curving round the umbones and extending to
the edge. Like the black-edge meleagrina, the
nacre at the edge is discolored. In this case by
a bluish or purplish tint.</p>

<p>Some idea of the enormous quantities of
mussels contained in some of these beds in our
western rivers may be gained from the reports
of the fisheries in the first years of their discovery.
Ten thousand tons of shells were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>taken in three years near New Boston, Ill.,
from one bed. Reckoned by the usual average
this would mean not less than 100,000,000
shells. In some beds, the mussels have been
found several feet deep, the bottom layers being
dead.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the enormous numbers,
these beds are often completely exhausted in
a few seasons. When the beds are first discovered,
men will take as much as 1500 to
2000 pounds of shell each, in a day's fishing.
In one hundred pounds of shells as they are
taken, the average number of valves or half
shells will be, nigger-heads, about one thousand;
sand-shells, nine hundred; muckets, eight
hundred, which would be an average of nine
thousand mussels per ton.</p>

<p>The meat in a ton of nigger-heads weighs
over three hundred pounds. This is usually
removed by the fishermen by boiling the
mussels for ten or fifteen minutes in crude sheet
iron tanks when the shells open and the fleshy
part falls out or may be easily removed by
hand. To show how little the pearls they may
contain enter into the calculations of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>fishermen, it may be stated here that the shell-buyers
pay about twenty-five per cent. less
for the mussels as taken from the river than
they do for the shells when cleaned.</p>

<p>On the Californian coast when the divers
worked independently, they preferred to sell
the oysters unopened. They received about
$4.50 per thousand on an average for the shells
and double for the oysters complete.</p>

<p>The fishing season for pearlers is from August
to December. The large operations for shell,
in the early days of the industry, were confined
to the same period, but of late, fishing is carried
on throughout the year, immense quantities
being taken through the ice. The shells are
better in cold weather, being less brittle than
when exposed in the boats during warm weather.
Fishing through the ice is very wasteful however,
as the undersized, which are dropped back
from the scoops and rakes in the summer, when
thrown out on the ice are allowed to remain
there and die.</p>

<p>The price of shells varies considerably from
season to season. An average price for nigger-heads
is about ten dollars per ton; sand-shells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>bring about twice as much, muckets half that
price, and the other varieties together will
average about twenty-five per cent. more than
nigger-heads, though among these the deer-horn
is worth about four times as much as the
nigger-head.</p>

<p>In the first six months of 1898 nearly four
thousand tons of mussel shells were sold by
mussel fishermen on the Mississippi. They
brought about thirty-nine thousand dollars,
94 per cent. of these were nigger-heads.</p>

<p>The spawning time of the unio varies with
different species. In the central Mississippi
basin it is normally February, March and April
for nigger-head, and summer and early fall for
the mucket and sand-shell.</p>

<p>The unio is a slow growing animal. Under
normal conditions it takes ten years for a nigger-head
to reach a size of three inches; fifteen
to eighteen years to attain a shell diameter of
4-1/2 inches. This corresponds very closely with
the life of the meleagrina, though the shell of
the latter ceases to grow in size at about eight
or ten years. After that it continues to lay on
thickness up to eighteen or twenty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>
<p>Although the discoveries so far in Africa are
unimportant, it is possible, now that the unio
is known to exist there, that the streams of
that wonderful land of precious things may
add a companion gem to the vast natural
hoards there of the diamond. In two years
succeeding his first find, the discoverer secured
one hundred and fifty pearls at an average of
one pearl to eight hundred shells.</p>

<p>Authorities tell us that the nucleus of a
mussel-pearl is usually the larva of a distoma.
Nuclei of pearls vary according to the circumstances
surrounding the beds of the shell-fish
and those circumstances have much to do with
the occurrence of the pearl.</p>

<h2>PRICE </h2>


<p>Value, except in things which are constant
and constantly changing hands, is a matter of
opinion. Price is the expression of that opinion
in money terms. Except in a few staple
sizes and qualities, pearls are affected by
so many details which determine their value
that it is difficult to formulate rules to correspond
and establish a base by which all may
be judged.</p>

<p>Shape, size, color, luster, and perfection,
afford a multiplicity of combinations sufficient
to puzzle the judgment of the most expert, and
when to this is added the fact that there is no
other one like the piece to be valued so as to
gauge opinion, there remains but one finality,
the agreement between buyer and seller on a
price.</p>

<p>Disregarding the fluctuations of price occasioned
by temporary influences and the variations
arising from local causes, this chapter is
intended to give information of the price of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>pearls in the United States to retail dealers,
and an idea of the relative value of different
qualities and shapes.</p>

<p>First it should be remembered that the price
of pearls is reckoned by the square of the weight,
with the pearl-grain, 1/4 carat, as the unit. Given
the price at $3.00 per grain base or multiple,
a half grain pearl would be half of $3.00 or
$1.50 per grain flat, or seventy-five cents for
the pearl. At the same price a one grain pearl
would be at $3.00 per grain multiple, $3.00
per grain flat and $3.00 for the pearl. Upon
the same basis a two grain pearl would be twice
three are six, $6.00 per grain flat and twice six
are twelve, $12.00 for the pearl. Or it may be
stated thus: multiply the grain number by
itself and the product by the base price, as a
6 gr. pearl at $3.00 base, 6 Ã— 6 = 36 Ã— 3 = 108
dollars, the price of the pearl. This rule applies
to all but rejections or those too
poor for classification, and extraordinary pieces
which by their extreme rarity pass beyond
the governance of rules. The sign used in
quoting a multiple price is a square. This
placed after a price quoted means that it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>the multiple price per grain, not the flat grain
price.</p>

<p>The price of pearls has increased even more
than that of diamonds in the last fifteen years.
In common with many other things it has risen
with the rapid increase of wealth and the
tremendous additions to the world's stock of
the standard or measure of values,â€”gold. Beyond
this, the demand for pearls, owing to the
adoption of them as a fashion in the United
States where a large proportion of the world's
wealth is being created, has been stimulated to
such a degree that the price of them has advanced
in a greater ratio to the depreciation of
gold and other forms of wealth than most
commodities.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago good round Indian pearls
up to five grains could be bought for $1.50
base; to-day such pearls would cost $4.50 base
and whereas in those days pieces of extraordinary
luster were allowed to remain in the parcels
and were sold at the same rate with the others,
they are now culled from the lots and held for
extraordinary prices. Size also now counts
beyond the multiple of the square. The quality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>held at $4.50 base up to five grains costs $6.00
above that size, and at ten grains will bring
$8.00 and over.</p>

<p>The yield of fine white pearls in sizes over ten
grains is not large and as there has been and is
a steady demand for large pearls for the centres
of necklaces, sizes from ten to fifteen grains
bring from eight to eleven dollars multiple
when matched. Egg and pear-shaped pearls
of the same grade, from five grains down, are
worth twenty-five to thirty per cent. less than
round pearls; between five and ten grains ten
to fifteen per cent. less, and as they near
fifteen grains and over the pear-shape become
of equal value with the round.</p>

<p>Imperfections which can be hidden by the
setting decrease the price twenty to thirty
per cent., and there is about the same difference
between button and round pearls, according
to the size of the plane. The difference is still
greater in the larger sizes. A yellow color
reduces the value in the market from fifteen to
fifty per cent. according to the depth and
quality of the tint. The so-called blue pearls,
which are of a dark leaden white, are worth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>about half as much as ordinary white, and
about one-third the price of fine white Indians.
These blue pearls must not be confounded with
the deep gray, slate, or black pearls, included
in the general term black pearls, as the latter
frequently command fancy prices.</p>

<p>Salt-water pearls taken from the smaller
varieties of the avicula of some seas, though
of the same grade in the qualities of color,
luster and shape, are nevertheless worth less
than Indian pearls, because they lack a certain
quality of texture which the latter, together
with those of some other waters, possess to an
eminent degree.</p>

<p>American fresh-water pearls have been and
are lower in price than Orientals. They have
however commanded much better prices of
late than formerly and are increasing in value.
At present they bring about one-third less than
corresponding qualities from the seas. There
is a greater difference in the price of baroques.
Fine Venezuelan baroques from a half to seven
or eight grains are worth now thirty-five to
fifty cents base.</p>

<p>Some of these when mounted appear like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>round or pear-shape pearls and are in good
demand. Larger pieces can rarely be made to
appear other than baroque and do not therefore
command as good figures. They seldom
bring more than five dollars per grain flat, in
sizes from ten to twenty grains. Fresh-water
pearls likewise fetch better prices reckoned by
the multiple in the smaller sizes, though they
are usually quoted by the grain flat at five to
twenty-five cents under ten grains, and twenty-five
cents to three dollars per grain in larger
sizes.</p>

<p>Iridescent, finely tinted, very lustrous, strawberry,
and rose baroques of large size, are worth
five dollars per grain and very exceptional
pieces bring even more. Slugs, or ordinary
baroques, are sold all the way from six dollars
an ounce to ten cents per grain. Good wing-pearls
can be bought at one to five cents per
grain; small wings and rejections are sold by
the ounce.</p>

<p>Perfectly round fresh-water pearls of good
quality and even skin are rare and prices are
advancing steadily. Good buttons have advanced
fully twenty-five per cent. in the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>year. Fine fancies such as were found at one
time in the Sugar River, Wisconsin, since the
fisheries there have been exhausted, are scarce
and high.</p>

<p>The low prices paid by button manufacturers
for mussel shells for the mother-of-pearl in
them during the past year, has been one of the
chief factors in reducing the quantity of pearls
found and the consequent increase of price.
It seldom pays the fisher to gather mussels for
pearls only; it is the steady returns from the
sale of the shells which ensures an adequate
reward for his labors. Shells that once brought
twenty dollars per ton fell during the early part
of 1905 to a third of that amount and later
went as low as two dollars and a half. They are
now going up again.</p>

<p>Many pearls are seriously injured by the
practice of fishers who rely upon the sale of
the shells for their returns, of throwing the
mussels into vats of hot water to open them.
The pearls released from the shells fall to the
bottom and getting too near the hot iron are
killed, which means that the luster is partially
or wholly destroyed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>
<p>Dredging is now quite common and is doing
much to deplete the mussel-beds of the west.
When one bed is completely divested of shells,
the clammer moves on to another and repeats
the process, so that the supply of fresh-water
pearls is coming to depend on the constant
discovery of new mussel-beds. Unless legislation
regulates the industry the American
supply will soon cease.</p>

<p>The cheapest fresh-water pearls in the market
to-day are the finest. The pearlers along the
streams of the west and south will no longer
part with the pearls they find to the speculators
at the old time prices. In fact they generally
want much more than they are worth and
often get more than the speculator can afford
to pay to ensure a profit when he comes to sell
them in the business centres.</p>

<p>But these fishers know little of the merits
and value of the finer qualities. They do not
yet realize the great difference in value which
accrues as the pearl exceeds the average of
luster, color, or perfection, consequently the
speculator can often buy a very fine pearl for
little more than he would have to pay for an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>ordinary pearl and though he knows that the
piece is worth much more than he has paid, and
tries to get as nearly what it is worth as he can,
both his judgment and disposition to sell are
affected by the low price he has paid and the
chances are that he too in turn will sell it at
much less than its relative value as compared
with the ordinary market price of poor or
medium quality goods.</p>

<p class="caption">THE MARCHIONESS OF LONDONDERRY</p>
</div>

<p>This condition will gradually change. As in
the past the fisher learned more and more of the
market value of ordinary pearls, so also he will
learn to know the price of exceptional pieces and
to know them when he has them. Even now,
speculators hold fine large pearls at high prices
because of the ready sale for them in Europe.</p>

<p>It is difficult to compare the price of pearls
in ancient times with that of to-day. We make
much finer and closer assortments and gradations
of quality and the business now is on a
more distinctly commercial basis. People
generally are better informed and more critical;
they are not influenced by wonder, sentiment,
superstition and the "Arabian Nights" atmosphere,
as much as formerly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>
<p>The Orient is not as strange and far away as
it was. In the old times, jewellers could and
undoubtedly did take advantage of the awe
with which things from the mysterious East
were regarded, and of the general ignorance, to
obtain large sums for very ordinary if not inferior
gems. Even in these days, many are
influenced more by the source from whence they
come than by a critical knowledge of the gems
they buy. Some, who would not buy the most
beautiful fresh-water pearl, will pay an exorbitant
price for one poorer and less valuable
because it is oriental. La Pellegrina in the hands
of an obscure dealer would be passed unnoticed
by many who would be enraptured by a more
ordinary gem from a jeweller or person of
renown.</p>

<p>It is presumable therefore that prejudice was
more influential when ignorance prevailed to a
greater extent than now. John Spruce of
Edinburgh in 1705 complained that he could
not sell a necklace or pendant of fine Scotch
pearls in Scotland. He says "the generality
seek for oriental pearls because farther fetched,"
and continues: "At this very day I can show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>some of our own Scots pearls as fine, more hard
and transparent than any oriental. It is true
that the oriental can be easier matched,
because they are all of a yellow water, yet
foreigners covet Scots pearls."</p>

<p>The price in those days was regulated by
general appearance and loosely with regard to
weight, rather than by definite assortment
and the exact system of reckoning by the
multiple of the weight as now, for he says,
"If a Scotch pearl be of a fine transparent
color and perfectly round and of any great
bigness, it may be worth 15 to 50 rix dollars,
yea I have given 100 rix dollars (about $82.00
U. S.) for one."</p>

<p>In 1862, Scotch pearls sold for about seventy-five
cents to ten or twelve dollars each, an
extraordinary piece bringing occasionally as
much as twenty-five dollars, but after they were
brought to the favorable notice of persons of
distinction and it was known that Queen
Victoria had bought one for one hundred and
ten dollars, the price of them quadrupled. In
the time of Charles <abbr title="2">II</abbr>. of England an Irish pearl
weighing 144 grains was valued at two hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>dollars. In London during the early part of
the nineteenth century, pearls from Panama of
good size and quality brought about four
dollars per grain.</p>

<p>About 1865, fine oriental pearls were sold in
London for $1.25 to $1.50 per grain in sizes up
to three grains. Over that the price increased
gradually with the size so that five grainers were
worth about $2.50 per grain; ten grainers, $5.50
per grain; twenty grainers $13.00 per grain and
thirty grainers about $17.00 per grain. If their
fine grade equalled ours, there has been a
remarkable advance in the last forty years, as
fine oriental round pearls of thirty grains to-day,
are worth in the United States $240.00 per
grain flat.</p>

<p>Up to this time and after, prices were quoted
very generally by the carat. Later, the method
of reckoning by the square or multiple became
more general, and the price went to about two
dollars per carat, in London, or fifty cents per
grain base for ordinary sizes, the larger ones
being valued by the piece according to the
individual rarity and particular qualities, as
before. At the Navigator's islands in 1858,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>fine round pearls of one to two grains were
valued at about fifty cents per grain, the price
increasing until those of twenty grains were
considered worth twenty dollars per grain.
Second class pearls under one grain, averaging
half a grain, were sold for about five cents a
grain. The same grade about nine grains
average, were worth about sixty-five cents per
grain.</p>

<p>A third and fourth grade brought about
twenty-five and fifty per cent. less respectively.
These prices, compared with those of London, indicate
that fine, large, round pearls commanded
better prices then in the East than they did
in Europe. Seed pearls sold at Tahiti for ten
to fifteen dollars per pound. The island of
Labuan, a British possession in the East Indian
archipelago, shipped pearls to Singapore in
the sixties at an average price of ten to fifteen
cents per grain. In 1871, 35 ounces of pearls
shipped from Guayaquil were valued at $100.00
per ounce.</p>

<p>As in former times, at many places where the
fishing is done by independent naked divers,
especially among the remote islands of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>South Sea, there is no grading of pearls or
definite ideas of value. The natives dispose of
their pearls, as they are able, to traders, often
for a very small price. It is so to-day at many
points in the Sulu archipelago from Mindanao
to the Tawi Tawi islands. The smaller established
fisheries of the seas east of China assort
roughly and sell in bulk to buyers from neighboring
trading centers.</p>

<p>The output of the large fisheries is practically
controlled by the great merchants of neighboring
cities who know the methods and intricacies
peculiar to the localities. For instance,
the pearls of Ceylon go to Madras, and Bombay
handles the bulk of those from the
Arabian coast and the Red Sea. Lower
California pearls are marketed chiefly at La
Paz. Those from Venezuela are shipped principally
to Paris and definite figures cannot be
obtained. A few are brought to the United
States direct from Venezuela, chiefly by Syrians
who barter for them with the independent
divers. These traders have no knowledge of
market rates for assorted goods but sell them in
mixed lots for as much as they can get.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>
<p>The price of pearls of the first grade, in
Ceylon in 1904, weighing four grains and upwards
each, was about $5.00 per grain. At
Macassar, prices for the irregular shaped pearls
of the Dutch Indies ranged from twenty-five
cents to $1.25 per grain base according to
quality.</p>

<p>At the Ceylon fisheries, two-thirds of the
oysters taken have been the government's
share. These were auctioned off daily. The
prices varied considerably, not only from fishing
to fishing, but daily during the season. If the
oysters sold one day, yielded well, prices went
up and vice versa. In 1860, at the beginning of
the Tinnevelly fishery, they realized Rs 15.
($7.50) per thousand and rose later to Rs 40.
($20.00). In 1861 on the contrary they sold
in the early part of the season for $35.00 to
$40.00 and fell to $20.00, at one time touching
$8.50.</p>

<p>In 1871, the Tuticorin catch brought a little
over $40.00 per thousand average. The average
price paid in 1858 at the Ceylon fisheries
was a little less than ten dollars, and as the
pearl yield was good, the speculators made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>enormous profits. In consequence, the average
of 1859 went up to $22.50, the oysters bringing
at one time during the season as much as
$42.00; 1860 realized an average of $66.00, the
highest price paid during the season being
$90.00.</p>

<p>The fishery of 1863 though it realized more
for the government on account of the large
catch, brought an average of $33.50 per thousand
only. In 1874 the oysters brought about
$40.00 per thousand. Of late years the average
has been less, ranging from $12.00 to $14.00
though at times double that price has been
paid.</p>

<p>The pearls found in the oysters came quickly
into the hands of Hindu merchants who assorted
them and shipped a large part to Europe at
prices much less than those which rule in the
United States, though they usually made a
good profit over cost. With the leasing of the
Ceylon fisheries much of this speculative
business will undoubtedly be eliminated and
the pearls marketed at more regular prices.</p>

<p>At fisheries where mother-of-pearl is the chief
factor of the industry, it is difficult to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>statistics of the number or value of the pearls
found, but in a general way India governs the
market. Prices in other sections adjust themselves
to Madras and Bombay with such
modifications as quality and place would
naturally make.</p>

<p>Mother-of-pearl shell varies in price from
$250.00 to $500.00 per ton for Mexican to
$700.00 to $800.00 per ton for the white shell
of Australia and the South Sea.</p>

<h2>IMITATION AND DOCTORED PEARLS </h2>


<p>In common with all other precious things,
pearls have been long imitated. The early
method of making imitation or "mock-pearls"
as they were called, was to cut them out of the
mother-of-pearl and polish them. Another
crude way was to make solid beads of glass
containing various ingredients which gave them
a slight similarity to the nacreous luster of the
pearl. Beads of gypsum or alabaster were
soaked in oil and coated with wax. The scales
of the bleak fish dissolved in liquid ammonia or
vinegar, was also used for covering beads, the
solution imparting a somewhat pearly appearance.</p>

<p>To coat one thousand ounces of glass beads,
a French manufacturer used three ounces of
fish-scales, one ounce white wax, one ounce
pulverized alabaster and half an ounce fine
parchment glue. Another made beads of opal
glass which he covered with several layers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>isinglass; over this was laid another coating of
a mixture of spirits of turpentine and copal,
and a fat oil to exclude moisture from the
isinglass, following it with a thin layer of tinted
enamel to give resemblance to the orient of the
pearl.</p>

<p>Some claimed that the best artificial pearls
were made from pulverized pearls. Seed pearls
or valueless baroques were ground to a fine
powder, soaked in lemon-juice or vinegar and
mixed with gum tragacanth. The paste after
being shaped and partially dried, was then
enclosed in a loaf and baked in an oven. The
luster was obtained by a final coating of fish-scale
solution. A lighter and better imitation
was made by blowing hollow glass beads. The
inside surface was covered with a preparation
from the fish-scales, after which the bead was
filled with wax. This method continues in use
to-day.</p>

<p>The fish-scale solution used is a guanine,
the mucus which lubricates the scales of the
bleak fish (alburnus lucidus). The white scales
of the fish are carefully scraped into a horse-hair
sieve over a shallow tub of fresh water. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>first water is thrown away. The scales are then
washed and pressed. The mucus sinks to the
bottom and is gathered as an oily mass, very
brilliant and bluish-white. This is packed with
ammonia in tin boxes and sealed for shipment.
It takes about 20,000 fish to make one pound of
the mucus.</p>

<p>A cheap imitation pearl is made of opal glass,
a bluish-white milky appearing material, to
which a pearly effect is given by treating it
with fluoric acid. Imitation black pearls are
made from hematite, but as they require careful
finishing to hide the metallic luster and are
much heavier than pearls, they are seldom used.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Japanese have been much
more ingenious in their methods and have long
produced, with enforced aid from the animal,
imitations which are in part real pearl. The
former insert in the Chinese pearl-mussel
(anodonta herculea) small figures of Buddha
upon which the fish proceeds to deposit its
nacre. When they are coated, which occurs in
from one to two or three years, the pearly
figures are extracted and sold to the devout.</p>

<p>The Japanese do more. They attempt to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>produce a marketable gem and have so far
succeeded that a considerable number have
been sold of late in the United States and in
many cases the public buy them not knowing
that they are an artificial production. The base
upon which the nacre is deposited appears to
be composed of a substance resembling porcelain
shaped like a low dome hollowed out on the
under side and having a hole in the centre of
the cavity.</p>

<p>As there is no nacre on the under side, it
must, when the button is placed in the mussel,
be thereby protected from the action of the
fish except at the edges where the nacreous
deposit probably joins it to the shell but in
such a manner that it can be easily detached.
The pearl covered button is then fitted to a
piece of polished mother-of-pearl of the same
exterior size and shape and the two are neatly
joined, forming a double low domed piece of
pearl on one side, and mother-of-pearl on the
other. These Japanese pearls as they are called,
when mounted in a setting constructed to hide
the under side, have the appearance of imperfect
spheres of natural pearl.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>
<p>The beds where the culture of these artificial
pearls is carried on, are situated in the
Bay of Ago, a few miles south of the Temple
of Ise, in central Japan on the Pacific side. It
is a quiet piece of water, in a coast broken by
numerous inlets and coves. A little north of
the centre of the bay is a small island called
Tadoko where the necessary buildings and the
men connected with the industry are. Around
the island and near it, about 1,000 acres of
sea bottom are leased and used for the pearl
oyster cultivation. The water is about five
to seven fathoms deep.</p>

<p>The oyster used is the one common to the
waters of Japan, the Avicula martensii Dunker.
In May and June, stones weighing six to eight
pounds are scattered over the bottom of the
sheltered shallows which run up into the land,
where the spat is collected. The breeding
season is in July to August and in the latter
month very tiny shells attached to the stones
by the byssus may be seen already.</p>

<p>The number increases as the season advances
until in November, in order to protect the
young fish from the approaching winter cold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>the stones lying in very shallow water are
removed with the adhering oysters to deeper
waterâ€”over six feet. After three years the
oysters are taken out and the nuclei of the
culture pearl inserted. This done, they are
spread over the sea bottom, about one to every
square foot and left undisturbed for four years.
They are then taken out and opened and both
the culture pearls and whatever natural pearls
there may be, are harvested. At present,
upwards of a quarter of a million oysters are
treated annually.</p>

<p>Experiments are being made constantly, in
the United States and Europe, to improve upon
the hollow glass bead lined with fish-scale but
so far without success. The finest of these
imitate the natural pearl very well and if
finely mounted similar to the genuine, will
deceive many while worn. Closer observation
will reveal the glassy shine of the surface and
it will be found under the loup to contain
numerous small holes. The specific gravity is
also less.</p>

<p>One finds occasionally in lots, a mock-pearl
which has been cut and polished from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>mother-of-pearl, but imitations of this character
are scarce and find no place in the market. The
few made are found usually in parcels of fresh-water
pearls and are put there by unscrupulous
dealers, as also are hematite balls and even
buckshot, to be sold with the lot by weight as
genuine pearls.</p>

<p>Since the price of pearls has advanced so
rapidly, much ingenuity has been shown in the
improvement of poor pearls. Button pearls
grown to the shell are broken out and the under
or flat side carefully scraped and smoothed to
hide the irregular lines of juncture between
the pearl and the shell. Protuberances on the
surface of round pearls are scraped off and the
broken skin edges smoothed down so as to be
unnoticeable to the naked eye.</p>

<p>In a like manner chalky rings and spots are
toned down. Surface cracks are filled by soaking
the pearls in a solution and if the pearl has
been pierced, interior cracks can also be
rendered unobservable. A serious objection to
pierced pearls arises from the ease with which
interior defects can be doctored where the skin
is pierced and a boring made through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>nacreous layers. Not only are cracks made to
disappear, but coloring matter can be introduced
between the skins. A white pearl of
very poor color can by such means be changed
temporarily into a black pearl which will command
a fancy price. This illegitimate doctoring
of pearls, whereby defects are hidden and a
fictitious appearance of quality imparted to last
long enough to make sales at exorbitant prices,
should not be confounded with the legitimate
improvement of pearls which is now growing to
be an industry of some importance. Experts
are now able by careful manipulation to restore
to some extent the luster which has been lost
by wear or age.</p>

<p>Formerly this was done by skinning the
pearl, <i>i.e.</i>, removing the outer skin by peeling
it carefully off with the edge of a sharp knife, an
unsatisfactory method at best, as the under
skin may not be good and if all the outer skin
is not taken off, the broken edges of the layers
composing the skin, mar the luster and color
when the pearl is worn. Few also succeed in
removing a skin without scratching the new one
disclosed by its removal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>
<p>Pearls having a decidedly bad outer skin
with a good one under it, can only be materially
improved by removing the bad skin, but owing
to the liability of finding equally bad imperfections
underneath, or irregularities which
would necessitate the removal of several skins
with a consequent loss of size and weight, pearls
with minor imperfections or lack of luster are
now slowly rubbed between the fingers, the
abrasion being assisted by various substances
which differ with the judgment and experience
of the operator, the preparation being in all
cases kept secret by the expert using it. Many
fine pearls which have lost their pristine luster
are now considerably improved by this method,
and without the dangers involved and the
necessary loss of weight, consequent on peeling.</p>

<p>Large numbers of poor or imperfect pearls
are scraped or otherwise doctored by the traders
and speculators at the fisheries. These men
acquire such pearls at a slight cost, and by
various methods fix them so that by mixing
them in lots with good pearls, they often make
large profits. They also mix in many cracked
pearls. This is done more often at Margarita
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>and the other Venezuelan fisheries where the
proportion of cracked pearls is greater than in
the Indian and South Sea fisheries.</p>

<p>The skins of a pearl may also be removed by
the application of weak acids, but this method
requires careful and expert handling or the
acid will act irregularly and leave the surface,
if improved in luster, uneven and pitted.</p>

<p>Few important fresh-water baroques and
irregular pearls leave the west without receiving
the attention of the speculators through whose
hands they pass, and the scraping is often very
roughly done. Rough and discolored projections
are broken or filed off and then scraped
over with a knife edge. While fresh, the broken
skin edges left thus will often pass unnoticed
by a careless buyer, but they become discolored
and dead later. Unless one buys of a dealer in
whom implicit confidence may be placed, not
alone for honesty but for his knowledge of
pearls, it is better to examine all pearls under a
glass before purchasing.</p>

<p>As many persons both in the trade and out
of it, are not sufficiently familiar with pearls
to be quite sure of their ability to detect the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>genuine from fine imitations, the following
points of difference will be of service. All
imitation pearls made of some solid material
are heavier than the genuine and lack the pearly
characteristics of the fine imitations even. If
made of solid glass without acid finish, they
are shiny and too poor to require a second consideration,
if acid finished they have a "ground-glass"
appearance which is unmistakable. If
made of other material of a vitreous nature,
they are heavier than pearls, dull in luster or
without luster, dark in color and unmistakably
lacking in pearly characteristics. The only
dangerous imitations are the Japan culture
pearls and the hollow, glass bead-pearls. The
former may always be recognized by the mother-of-pearl
back, the latter by various signs.</p>

<p>All these hollow glass beads, have one or
two holes. They are coated on the inside with
fish-scale solution and filled with wax. Some
are treated with acid or sand-blasted to tone
down the shiny, glassy appearing surface, and
to hide the blow-holes in the glass. The effect
is quite pearly, but the color is somewhat darker
and they show some iridescence. Without the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>surface treatment they are more shiny and
under the loup one will discover the small
blow-holes peculiar to surfaces which have been
molten.</p>

<p>The rims of the holes have a smooth, rounded,
congealed appearance, whereas holes in pearls
have a rough, square, chalky edge. On looking
diagonally into the hole of a glass bead, the
glass will appear as a dark ring against the wax
filling, and where there are two holes, one will
almost invariably have a ring in the glass, a
short distance from and around it. The surface
over the ring is smooth, though it looks as if it
were ridged; the ring is in the glass, not on it.</p>

<p>These hollow-blown glass pearls are lighter
than the real pearls also. There is one never
failing test however which discovers even the
best of these most dangerous imitations. Drop
a small spot of ink from the point of a pen upon
one, and hold it between the eye and the light,
when two spots will appear, the one nearest to
the eye being a reflection from the inner wall
of the glass resting against the wax, of the
actual ink spot on the surface. The duplicate
spot will be lighter in color than the original.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>On a real pearl there would be no such reflection,
nor would it appear on a solid bead imitation,
but as before stated, the weight of the latter
betrays them, as they are heavier than the real,
nor do they look as pearly, and on holding
them between the eye and light they do not
show the translucency at the edge of the circumference
peculiar in a more or less degree,
to the gem.</p>

<h2>FACTS AND FANCIES </h2>


<p>In ancient days there was a belief in the east
that at the full of the moon the pearl-oyster
rose to the surface of the sea and opened its
shell to receive the falling dew-drops. These
congealing, hardened into pearls. Similarly,
the natives of India believed that Buddha in
certain months showered upon the earth, dew-drops
from heaven, which the oyster, floating
on the waters to breathe, received and held
until they hardened and became pearls. These
poetical imaginations of the Orientals were
carried west with the pearls. Poets embodied
them in verse. Prose writers, losing the poetry
of the fable, trimmed them to the bare statements
of impossible facts. An English writer
early in the eighteenth century speaking of the
mussels in the streams of northern England said
that "gaping eagerly and sucking in their dewy
streams they did conceive and bring forth a
great plenty of pearls."</p>

<p>Later writers also attributed the origin of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>pearls to the reception of raindrops from
heaven by the oyster, and one gravely asserted
that the fishermen always found more
pearls after a season of heavy rains. He did
not state that the oysters rose to the surface
of the sea to receive the raindrops,
neither did he explain how these drops from
heaven passed through the brine to the oyster
inviolate. Pliny was more definite; he stated
that the quality of the pearls varied with that
of the dew from which they were formed and
were clear or turbid as it was. The pearl would
be pale-colored if the weather was cloudy when
the dew fell into the shell, and large if the dew
was plentiful. Thunder during the reception
of the drop resulted in a hollow pearl and if
lightning caused the shell to close suddenly the
pearl would be small.</p>

<p>The people of Java and Borneo had a belief
which should have been yet more difficult to
acquire. They asserted that the pearls themselves
breed and increase in number if placed in
cotton. Clusters of twinned pearls were said
to be produced thus, and it is related that some
had the audacity to sell breeding pearls claiming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
to distinguish the male from the female.
This fable also travelled west and was received
by the credulous. M. S. Lovell in his "Edible
Mollusks" says, "A Spanish lady informed a
friend of mine that if seed-pearls were shut up
in cotton-wool they would increase either in
size or in number."</p>

<p>To this day the ancient superstition, or belief,
is believed not only by sea-board Malays, but
by Europeans, and there are those who claim
to own breeding pearls and to have bred from
them. The pearls are placed in a box with a
layer of cotton-seed and a few grains of rice,
under and over them. The box is then closed
and in a year, if one account given is a fair
statement of average results, one may look for
a four-fold increase, though the children will
not be as large as the parents. Some of them
may be as large as a pin head. The rice will
look crumbly and worm-eaten.</p>

<p>Another breeder of pearls says that the
breeding pearls themselves grow in size and if
the box has been kept undisturbed, there will
be found with them at the end of the year
others of various sizes, some almost microscopic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>A year later these would be larger. It is also
said that when a pearl is about to breed, a
small black speck makes its appearance on the
surface, and that during the period of breeding
the pearl changes its shape from a sphere to
an irregular ovoid, and develops layers of scales
on the surface visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>After a time, the breeding pearls change their
orient to a dirty white, the scales having peeled
off. In all cases the rice looks as though some
beetle had taken a circular bite out of the end
of each kernel. Somehow a perusal of the
accounts of the remarkable results, leaves the
reader with a conglomerate impression of
transformed rice and imagination.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the breeding of pearls in cotton-wool
or cotton-seed with rice, is asserted and
believed, and the methods by which the wonder
is accomplished may be had with great circumstance
and some variations from those who have
experimented. No greater evidence exists of
the child-like faith of people in the old times
than the incredible stories about precious stones
which were current in those days.</p>

<p>It is equally wonderful that although it took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>centuries to disprove them, they received
credence for more centuries after they were
shown to be impossible and one hears those
same delightful fairy stories about angel's tears,
drops of dew from heaven, raindrops, etc., seriously
quoted in this matter-of-fact land to-day,
often by people who after a moment's thought
would become conscious of their fallacy.</p>

<p>But romance abhors reason, and though
oysters cannot rise to the surface of the sea,
nor raindrops pass immaculate through the
ocean to the gaping mollusks, nor the downpour
of one season increase the yield at once of things
which are the growth of years, there will long
remain some who will refuse the dictum of the
biologist, that unless the dews of heaven and
the tears of angels carry much lime in solution,
the calcareous surroundings of the oyster's bed
must have more to do with the genesis of the
pearl than anything dropped into the ocean by
the clouds above it, and will still cling to fancy
in the face of fact. Meantime the priests of
Buddha exact charity oysters from the fishers
of their faith, that the god thus propitiated may
cause the oysters to yield more pearls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>
<p>A question often raised, and which by its
periodical revival seems to be a favorite with
newspapers and magazines, as well as, to the
general public, is, "Do pearls live and die?"
It originated probably in observations of certain
changes that occasionally take place in
pearls which could be readily construed by a
speculative or imaginative mind to mean death.
Sometimes with pearls the brilliancy of youth
fades and passes and the clear skin of early
days takes on the hue of age.</p>

<p>If now a ready pen waited on fancy to state
the facts it would establish an imaginative
theory for centuries, for like gossip, a thing
once printed in a book will long pass on unquestioned
and be quoted or re-stated many times.
There are pearls which for certain qualities
invite as a descriptive term the word live.
There are others which by comparison appear,
and are described, as dead. Then there are
others that lose by untoward circumstances the
live qualities they once possessed and without
dying become dead pearls. The calcite carbonate
crystals of which they are formed dissolve
in acids and are affected to a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>extent by the acidity of the excretions of the
human skin, sufficiently in some cases to
destroy, or at any rate dim, their luster.</p>

<p>Gases in the atmosphere, sudden changes in
temperature, heat, and various other influences
operate more or less in the same direction. The
chemical changes thus produced might with
poetic license be called the death of the pearl
and in a sense the term would be true were the
whole pearl involved, but as a rule these misfortunes
affect the outer skin of the pearl only,
so if that dies death is but skin deep, a live
pearl remaining beneath it.</p>

<p>As life and death means the segregation of
particles into a compact individuality and their
final dissolution, pearls like all other things in
the restless economy of nature live and die, but
the loss of some of its native charms by the gem
is not more a sign of death than the rougher
cuticle of a weather beaten sailor with which exposure
has replaced the smooth skin of the boy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the idea of death coming to the
pearl fascinates and enterprising writers succeed
in frequently placing very interesting and
readable articles before the public which incite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>the wonderment of the reader and perpetuate
the impression that this beloved gem is some
sort of a living creature subject to human
vicissitudes. Lately a story appeared in current
publications which told how the pearls of a
lady's necklace sickened and lost their beauty.
Much distressed she carried them to the expert
dealer of whom she bought them who gravely
advised her to let her maid wear them whereupon,
they recovered from the illness and their
lustrous beauty was restored.</p>

<p>Twentieth century versions of fables older
than this era are common; shrewd traders and
writers use them, nor are they always careful
to attach the fable to the particular gem to
which, by right of ancient usage, it belongs.
The magical loss of color in the presence of
impending danger to its wearer is the ruby's
prerogative, but, though pearls may lose their
charms by exposure to heat, gas and rough
usage, the wily orientals of remote or later ages
provided no traditional recovery more wonderful
than the prosaic method of feeding them to
fowls and cutting them out of the gizzard an
hour or two later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>
<p>The pearl is generally considered to be the
emblem of innocence and purity. A pretty
fashion in vogue among parents who can afford
it, is of giving a pearl to each of their daughters
on their birthdays. These are carefully matched
and strung so that the string grows to a necklace
for maturer years.</p>

<p>Along with the emblematic idea and the
fanciful notion of their origin, there comes to
us from the old days a superstition concerning
pearls which probably grew out of the statement
that they were the congealed tears of
heaven. It was supposed that they brought
tears to their possessors. The idea originated
probably about a thousand years ago in western
Europe. It did not exist in Rome during the
time of the CÃ¦sars for the pearl was then the
sign of power and affluence and was coveted
by men and women alike and it remains a most
popular gem in Italy to-day.</p>

<p>This absurdity has been kept alive by stories
of prominent persons in whose experience
occurrences seemed to confirm the claim. The
Queen of Henry <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>. of France dreamt that
her diamonds were turned to pearls the night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>previous to her husband's assassination by
Ravaillac. The consort of James <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>. of Scotland
dreamt of pearls three nights in succession before
the disastrous battle of Flodden Field in which
he lost his life. These and similar stories which
appeal to a love of the mysterious and wonderful
have been perpetuated by writers of books,
so that even to-day there are women who
coveting pearls still fear to own them.</p>

<p>But to be out of the fashion is more dreadful
to women than tears, so it has come to pass that
with the increasing vogue of the pearl, less is
heard of the superstition and it is dying, not
of age or the contempt of knowledge, but by the
potency of fashion.</p>

<p>A story already referred to in these pages,
that has been current for over two thousand
years during which time it has been mentioned
by almost every writer about pearls, deserves,
for its antiquity and absurdity, consideration
here. It is of Cleopatra and the pearl worth
upwards of three hundred thousand dollars she
is said to have dissolved in wine to drink in
costly fashion to her lover. This was, of course,
impossible. She may, with the help of the wine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>have swallowed it like a pill or, as Sir Thomas
Gresham did later, have ground it to powder
and mixed it with the wine she drank, but to
dissolve a pearl of great size as one of this
value would be, was a conjurer's feat.</p>

<p>The lime of which a pearl is chiefly composed
will dissolve in acid, but the gem although
softened, would remain a pulpy mass held by
the organic matter interwoven throughout the
strata of calcium carbonate. Whatever she
really did, or in what form she swallowed the
pearl, if she did so, Cleopatra and her pearl
are better known to-day to the general public
than either of her Roman lovers, and they will
probably be handed down through many
generations yet to come.</p>

<p>To exaggerate is a common tendency. Dealers
usually place inordinately high figures on
exceptional gems which they do for several
reasons: the great price excites wonder and
interest; it makes a large profit possible; it
permits considerable reduction to a shrewd
buyer; and it pleases the person who finally
purchases it, for if the sale is made public the
first asking price is usually given as the value
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>of the jewel, and sometimes even that is exceeded.
The buyer prefers to have it so because
it increases the importance of his possession in
the public mind and paves the way for a good
price if he too at any time should wish to sell.</p>

<p>One reads constantly in the daily papers of
sales where the prices given are enormously
beyond the sums actually paid, for the public
like big figures. Reporters know this and do
not fail to supply the demand. For instance:
in an eastern city of the United States, a man
while at a lunch counter found a pearl in the
oyster he was eating. He took it at once to
a jeweller of his acquaintance who handed it to
a New York pearl-dealer present and asked
him to value it.</p>

<p>The pearl was large and round but, like all
such formations in the edible oyster, quite
devoid of the nacre which constitutes a true
pearl. The dealer so informed them, adding
casually, "If it were a true pearl it would be
worth several thousand dollars." An evening
paper that day had a half column story about
it with, "A pearl worth five thousand dollars
found in an oyster at a lunch-counter," in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>black head-lines, and the morning papers of
the following day enlarged the story by adding
fanciful details.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly in the old days of license when
immense fortunes were made not only in trade
but by piratical wars, large prices were paid by
fortune's favorites for pearls but it is extremely
probable that report, bruited from mouth to
mouth, exaggerated even more than the printed
fables of our times do. It is doubtful if the
pearls of ancient chronicles were as fine, judged
by the standards of to-day, as we imagine or
that all of them were as large as reported. The
public were more ignorant about them than
now and also more credulous and these invite
exaggeration.</p>

<p>Very large pearls which for perfection of
shape, luster and freedom from flaws are beyond
criticism, are the most rare of all gems. The
conditions under which a pearl grows, makes
large size, without the development of irregularities
in the form and imperfections in the
skin, almost impossible; and as they all grow
in the same way, by the same process, out of the
same sources of supply and subject to the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>limitations, we find big and little, fine and
ordinary, in about the same proportions as
they occurred thousands of years ago; the fish
that made them then makes them now, in the
same kind of a narrow workshop and within
the bounds of a life whose duration has not
changed.</p>

<p>Of very ancient historic pearls, the only one
of which we have reliable and expert knowledge,
is that of the Shah of Persia seen by
Tavernier. This and La Peregrina are supposed
to be still in existence. Of the very large pearls
generally mentioned by writers, three undoubtedly
exist, viz., La Pellegrina, the Beresford
Hope and one of medium quality in the Austrian
Crown weighing about twelve hundred grains.</p>

<p>It is probable that very many pearls have
been found, which if generally known would
have become celebrated, but of those chronicled,
most have passed out of public knowledge.
It is probable that some of those about which
much has been written were not as beautiful
as others which have escaped notoriety. The
writer's habit of drawing upon the past to
illustrate a subject, has narrowed the literature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>of pearls to reiterated records of a few great
pearls which one by one have been brought to
public notice during the past centuries.</p>

<p>Exact and reliable statements about gems
are a modern innovation. In the old times
unverified report was the only evidence the
general public had of them. Crown jewellers,
not always quite reliable, would make public
some statements in general terms about the
jewels of a reigning house. Occasionally, as in
the case of France, the state had the crown
jewels inventoried so that some fairly definite
knowledge could be had of them. Infrequently
a traveller published his observations, made
under more or less favorable circumstances,
of the jewels of some oriental prince. Chief
of these was Tavernier, the French jeweller.
He not only had expert knowledge of gems but
was able by recommendations of the French
court, to gain such access to the jewels of
eastern princes and dealers that he could make
critical examinations of them.</p>

<p>For various reasons it is extremely difficult
also in these days to obtain accurate knowledge
of extraordinary gems. Dealers for business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>reasons are chary of information, nor will they
make such pieces common by allowing many to
see and handle them. The buyer is equally
averse to publicity, so that exact knowledge
does not pass far beyond the dealer and his
customer as a rule.</p>

<p>The finest pearl known is that in the Museum
of Zosima, in Moscow, called La Pellegrina.
It is perfectly round and so lustrous that it
appears to be transparent. It weighs about
112 grains and was bought of the captain of an
East India ship at Leghorn.</p>

<p>The largest known pearl to-day is in the
Beresford Hope collection shown at the South
Kensington Museum, London. It is two inches
long and its circumference is four and a half
inches. It weighs three ounces (1818 grains).</p>

<p>Tavernier saw a pearl in 1663 belonging to
the Shah of Persia which was valued at 3200
tomans or about $320,000 of our money. It
was very perfect, pear-shaped, and nearly three
inches long. It is believed to have come from
the ancient fishery at Catifa in Arabia. Even
this great sum was exceeded by Pliny in his
estimate of the pearl Cleopatra is said to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>swallowed. He placed the value of that at
$375,000. As the Shah's pearl was about
three inches long, Cleopatra's must have been
large enough to reflect on the story connected
with it.</p>

<p>It is said Julius CÃ¦sar presented a pearl
valued at an equivalent of nearly $250,000 to
Servilla the sister of Cato of Utica and mother
of Marcus Junius Brutus. The pearl taken from
the ear-drop of Caecilia Metella by Clodius to
dissolve and drink in vinegar was valued at
$40,000.</p>

<p>A large pear-shaped pearl weighing one
thousand grains was found at the island of
Margarita off the Colombian coast and given
to Philip <abbr title="2">II</abbr>. of Spain. Some reports say it was
obtained in 1579; others give the date as 1560
and say it was presented to the monarch by
Don Diego de Temes. It was valued then at
something over $30,000, but Freco, the king's
jeweller, said it might be worth twice to twenty
times as much for such a gem was priceless.
It was later known among the crown jewels as
La Peregrina. Prior to this, a companion of
Magellan reported having seen two pearls as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>large as hen's eggs in the possession of the
Rajah of Borneo.</p>

<p>The pearl which Sir Thomas Gresham drank
in his wine to Elizabeth of England is said to
have been worth seventy-five thousand dollars.
It was reported some years ago that the Queen
of the Gambiers owned a pearl of extraordinary
luster, as large as a pigeon's egg. There is a
story that in 1779 a pearl weighing 2312 grains
which cost in India $22,500, was offered for
sale in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petersburg. It was called the
sleeping lion because of its shape and must
have been therefore a baroque.</p>

<p>The republic of Venice presented a pearl to
Soliman The Magnificent, Sultan of Turkey,
which was valued at $80,000, and Pope Leo <abbr title="10">X</abbr>.
bought one of a Venetian jeweller for $70,000.
These sums make the prices of to-day seem
insignificant and it is very probable that many
of the pearls which brought such large amounts
would not pass criticism now. Perhaps one
reason for the scarcity of large pearls among
those taken from the fisheries in this age is
that many of them are classed as baroques or
are not sufficiently fine and perfect to attract
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>attention. They pass therefore among those
considered unworthy of notice.</p>

<p>A brown pearl valued at $25,000 was exhibited
by Marchisini of Florence at the Maritime
International Exhibition at Naples in 1871.
Among the Dudley pearls exhibited at the
London Exhibition of 1872 was a necklace of
exceptionally fine pearls valued at $150,000.
The late Czar of Russia spent twenty-five years
in collecting sufficient perfect Virgin pearls to
form a necklace for his wife. The Countess
Henckel owns a necklace of pearls which for
value and associations is unrivalled. It is
composed of three strands, each at one time
being a separate and historical necklace. One
was the famous necklace belonging to the
Empress EugÃ©nie which has been valued at
Â£20,000; one known as "the necklace of the
Virgin of Atokha," formerly owned by a
member of the Spanish nobility, the third
belonged to the ex-Queen of Naples. For
value this is exceeded by a single strand
necklace of large pearls lately bought by a
western millionaire of the United States. It is
composed of thirty-seven pearls ranging from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>eighteen to fifty-two and three-quarter grains
each, the latter being the largest central pearl.
The combined weight of the pearls is 979-3/4
grains and the value is given at $400,000.</p>

<p>A very beautiful and nearly perfect pear-shaped
pearl was found on the north-east coast
of Australia in the seventies. It weighed 159
grains. There is a pearl about the size of a
pigeon's egg in the French crown jewels, valued
at $8,000. Many fine pearls, especially black
or colored, have been found on the Mexican
coast during the last twenty-five years, among
them a black pearl of 162 grains and another of
108 grains, a white pear-shape weighing 176
grains, an oval of 128 grains, and three weighing
300 grains, 180 grains and 372 grains respectively,
the first two being found in the same
year.</p>

<p>In the World's Fair in Paris, 1889, seven
black pearls from this district, valued at $22,000
were exhibited. These and others are described
in "Gems and Precious Stones" by Kunz. No
fresh-water pearl has attained an equal notoriety
with the Queen pearl found at Notch
Brook near Paterson, New Jersey, in 1857. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>weighed 93 grains and was sold to the Empress
EugÃ©nie.</p>

<p>Another round pearl of 400 grains, ruined
by boiling, had it been properly extracted from
the mussel, would probably have been the
finest and most notable pearl of this age, though
another as large as a pigeon's egg, dropped from
the mollusk and lost when the shell was opened,
might have rivalled it. The finder was wading
in a stream in Ohio, feeling for the projecting
edges of the mussels with his feet, and opening
them as he brought them to the surface, as was
custom there. This, however, may have been
like the fish that got away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>
<h2>PEARLS IN LITERATURE </h2>


<p>In all countries where woman has been
enthroned in the respect as well as the affections
of man, the pearl has been inseparably connected
with her in his mind as a peculiarly fitting
accompaniment to feminine loveliness. In the
romantic dreams of youth, which hide betimes
the harsh realism of life under a golden haze of
imagery; where belted knights and fair ladies
live and move unfettered, and all the impossible
delights of sweet desire free from untoward
consequences are reasonable; where invincible
swords have no thought of the horrors of
carnage, and unimpeded love is without cold
calculation or following of sorrow, pearls
everywhere shimmer.</p>

<p>And when in his exalted moods man paints
the shadow picture of the goddess of his life,
he finds one gem alone befitting with which to
deck her, namely, the pearl. This has come to
pass probably because the ideal qualities of
woman and the sea-gem are alike, purity and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>modesty. The beauty of the most lustrous
pearl is unobtrusive and its quality is virginal.
In our visions of the spectral past, the shades of
the consorts of the mighty all wear them.</p>

<p>Pearls hang pendent from the ears of Egypt's
voluptuous queens, and Rome's proud matrons.
Pearls clasp the dainty flesh of Moslem houris
and rest in the soft folds of draperies that cling
about those daughters of the Orient, the common
mortals of their day might not look upon.
Great pearls hang festooned and pendent round
the necks of lightly draped Dianas of the
warm south lands, and coiled about the brown
arms of the daughters of the chiefs in far-off
islands of the South Seas.</p>

<p>Upon reclining figures in the ancient palaces
of Persia and Arab tents: wherever the proud
women of the conquering occident move in
stately measure across the high terraces of
noble placement: in all dreams of fair women
and brave men, are swords and pearls. And
this is so because in all the ages, women of
high position have loved pearls and writers
have told it. In our old world so far, neither
earth nor sea has yielded ought else so fit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>to lie in the bosom of woman, or to symbolize
her character and beauty, as the chaste and
dainty pearl.</p>

<p>This high atmosphere of precious supremacy
and reverence, which surrounds the gem now
as it has for more than twenty centuries, is a
legacy of Rome. The east loved pearls as
beautiful and precious trinkets; while Rome
gave to them imperial honors and drew around
them the mystic circle of patrician favor. And
since that day, in every land where an aristocracy
existed or came into existence, pearls
have been the familiars of the exclusive.</p>

<p>This natural fitness of the gem for refined
associations is recognized by Emerson in his
"Friendship." He says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Thou foolish Hafiz! Say! do churls</div>
 <div class="verse"> Know the worth of Oman's pearls?</div>
 <div class="verse"> Give the gem which dims the moon</div>
 <div class="verse"> To the noblest, or to none.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">It is a late echo of the scriptural saying, "Cast
not your pearls before swine." No modern
poet shows more knowledge of the nature, or
a more just appreciation of the delicate beauty
of the gem than Emerson. In his "May Day,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>speaking of the tardiness of the spring, he writes:
"Slow grows the palm, too slow the pearl."</p>

<p>Evidently he knew of the slow process by
which the successive coats of filmy nacre
increase the size of the growing gem. Likewise
a couplet in "Nature" betrays the poet's observation
of the iridescent nature of the colors in
mother-of-pearl, and in the gem occasionally
when those fleeting tints are added to the beauty
of its luster; the lines are a dainty illustration:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Illusions like the tints of pearl,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Or changing colors of the sky.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Some of the great poets, notably Tennyson,
apparently confuse the gem with its mother-of-pearl,
or refer to the latter only when they speak
of pearl. In his "Recollections of the Arabian
Nights," however, Tennyson in describing one
of his beauties evidently refers to the gem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="indent8"> And a brow of pearl</div>
 <div class="verse"> Tressed with redolent ebony.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Writing of the mermaid, the lines are more
suggestive of the shell nacre:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Combing her hair</div>
 <div class="verse"> Under the sea,</div>
 <div class="verse"> In a golden curl</div>
 <div class="verse"> With a comb of pearl.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Again in a sonnet, he evidently refers to mother-of-pearl
when he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> All night through archways of the bridgÃ¨d pearl,</div>
 <div class="verse"> And portals of pure silver, walks the moon.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This indiscriminate use of the gem's name to
appropriate its pearly characteristics is a common
poetic license. In Ben Jonson's "Hymn
to Diana," he bids her,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Lay thy bow of pearl apart.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sometimes metaphor is worse mixed, as
when Milton in "Paradise Lost" describes the
waters above the firmament about the gate of
Heaven thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="indent6"> And underneath a bright sea flowed</div>
 <div class="verse"> Of jasper, or of liquid pearl.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In this poem of gorgeous description, the
author makes several allusions to the gem and
some of them, especially those in his word
paintings of scenes in Eden, are poetically
beautiful and true. One delightful to the eye
of the mind,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> How from that sapphire fount the crispÃ¨d brooks</div>
 <div class="verse"> Rolling on orient pearls and sands of gold,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and another in the description of morning in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>Eden, equally beautiful though it takes more
license:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Now Morn, her rosy steps in th' eastern clime</div>
 <div class="verse"> Advancing, sow'd the earth with orient pearl.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">In his "Epitaph on the Marchioness of Winchester,"
a couplet shows that he was familiar
with the superstition of sorrow connected with
them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> And those pearls of dew she wears,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Proove to be presaging tears.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Herrick also associated pearls and tears though
more happily as in "Corinna's Maying."</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Besides, the childhood of the day has kept,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Against you come, some orient pearls unwept.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">The same poet makes charming reference to
pearls in his poem entitled: "To Daffodils."</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Or as the pearls of morning dew</div>
 <div class="indent4"> Ne'er to be found again.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Shakespeare made frequent reference to the
gem, sometimes to illustrate the magnificence
of wealth and station but more frequently in
connection with dew and tears. Oberon says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> And that same dew, which some time on the buds</div>
 <div class="verse"> Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">King Richard <abbr title="3">III</abbr>. when he argues with Queen
Elizabeth for her daughter's hand in marriage,
promises with smooth and brazen villainy to
so offset the wrongs he had done her, that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> The liquid drops of tears that you have shed</div>
 <div class="verse"> Shall come again, transformed to orient pearls.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">In "King John" Elinor speaking to Constance
of Arthur, says, "Draw those heaven moving
pearls from his poor eyes;" and in "King
Lear," one of the gentlemen, speaking of the
Queen of France when she received the news
he carried, describes her mood thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"> <div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="indent14"> Those happy smilets,</div>
 <div class="verse"> That played on her ripe lip, seemed not to know</div>
 <div class="verse"> What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence,</div>
 <div class="verse"> As pearls from diamonds dropp'd.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">In "Midsummer Night's Dream," Lysander says
to Helen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> To-morrow night, when PhÅ“be doth behold</div>
 <div class="verse"> Her silver visage in the wat'ry glass,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Among his recognitions of pearls as a sign of the
luxury of wealth and high position, he makes a
lord say, in the "Taming of the Shrew,"</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp'd</div>
 <div class="verse"> Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">And in "King Henry <abbr title="5">V</abbr>," the King while deploring
the sorrows incident to kingship, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="indent15"> 'Tis not</div>
 <div class="verse"> The intertissued robe of gold and pearl</div>
 <div class="verse"> That beats upon the high shore of this world.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">These two quotations indicate that the Roman
custom of decorating robes and even the harness
of horses with pearls was followed in Shakespeare's
day by the nobles.</p>

<p>A line suggestive of the high-esteem in which
the pearl was held in his day, and often quoted,
occurs in Othello's grand but heart-broken self-denunciation
just before he stabs himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="indent10"> Of one, whose hand</div>
 <div class="verse"> Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Richer than all his tribe.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">It is evident also that stories were current then
of the western Indian's ignorant prodigality
in the disposition of things common to him but
very precious among more enlightened people.</p>

<p>In "King Richard <abbr title="3">III</abbr>," Duke Clarence sees
in his dream of drowning, "Wedges of gold,
great anchors, heaps of pearl."</p>

<p>Several times the great dramatist puts the
gem in somewhat grewsome setting. In "A
Sea Dirge" however, the bare horror of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>idea which grins at one in similar connections,
is transformed by the poetry in which it is
draped:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> These are pearls that were his eyes:</div>
 <div class="indent4"> Nothing of him that doth fade,</div>
 <div class="verse"> But doth suffer a sea-change</div>
 <div class="indent4"> Into something rich and strange.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">A favorite use of the sea-gem by the lighter
poets is to adorn their images of physical
beauty. In "Don Juan," Byron, describing
one of the Turk's houris in the harem, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="indent6"> Was slumbering with soft breath,</div>
 <div class="verse"> And lips apart, which show'd the pearls beneath,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and another poet writes similarly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Those cherries fairly do enclose</div>
 <div class="verse"> Of orient pearls a double row.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Shelley confines his references to pearls almost
entirely to descriptions of Nature dew-bedecked,
as in the "Revolt of Islam,"</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> I sate with Cythna; drooping briony, pearled</div>
 <div class="verse"> With dew from the mild streamlet's shattered wave,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and another in "Prometheus Unbound" where
the chorus of spirits sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Nor aught save where some cloud of dew,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Hangs each a pearl in the pale flowers</div>
 <div class="verse"> Of the green laurel blown anew.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">In "Arethusa" he uses them to enhance the
idea of regal magnificence in these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Where the Ocean Powers</div>
 <div class="verse"> Sit on their pearlÃ¨d thrones.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">The poets rarely refer to the gem as a symbol
of spiritual attributes though it is peculiarly
adapted by its natural qualities to illustrate
purity, innocence, and other qualities of the
human soul: nor is it often connected with
religious ideas. Among the few, Andrew
Marvell in his "Song of the Emigrants in
Burmuda," avails himself of it somewhat
prosaically thus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> He cast (of which we rather boast)</div>
 <div class="verse"> The Gospel's pearl upon our coast.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">One of the most poetically beautiful references
ever made to the Ocean's modest jewel occurs
in the "The Rosary" by Robert Cameron
Rogers.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> The hours I spend with thee, dear heart,</div>
 <div class="indent4"> Are as a string of pearls to me;</div>
 <div class="verse"> I count them over every one apart,</div>
 <div class="indent10"> My rosary.</div>
 <div class="verse"> Each hour a pearl, each pearl a prayer,</div>
 <div class="indent4"> To still a heart in absence wrung;</div>
 <div class="verse"> I tell each bead unto the end, and there</div>
 <div class="indent10"> A cross is hung.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">No poet has made more frequent allusion to
pearls than Thomas Moore. His poems give
evidence that he had read much of them in
ancient writings and was alive to their poetic
value. In his description of Ireland in "Fairest!
Put on Awhile," the linesâ€”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Lakes, where the pearl lies hid,</div>
 <div class="verse"> And caves, where the gem is sleeping,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">were founded on the statements of Nennius, a
British writer of the IXth century, concerning
Irish pearls. In passing, it is worthy of notice
that Nennius recorded also that the princes of
Ireland hung them behind their ears; a fashion
similar to that of Persian and Athenian youth
many centuries earlier. From Cardanus, Moore
learned of the ancient fable that pearls were
improved by leaving them awhile with doves,
and utilizes the fancy in "A Dream of Antiquity"
thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> As pearls, we're told, that fondling doves</div>
 <div class="verse"> Have played with, wear a smoother whiteness.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">An early reference to the gem is found in his
"Odes of Anacreon" No. <abbr title="22">XXII</abbr>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Or even those envious pearls that show</div>
 <div class="verse"> So faintly round that neck of snowâ€”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">If this ode was really written by Anacreon, that
poet must have been more familiar with pearls
than some later Grecian writers. A similar
idea quite as beautifully expressed occurs in
"The Loves of the Angels."</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Then too the pearl from out its shell</div>
 <div class="indent4"> Unsightly, in the sunless sea,</div>
 <div class="verse"> (As 'twere a spirit, forced to dwell</div>
 <div class="indent4"> In form unlovely) was set free,</div>
 <div class="verse"> And round the neck of woman threw</div>
 <div class="verse"> A light it lent and borrowed too.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Unlike most of the poets, Moore does not
describe the sparkling dew-drop as pearly and
his references to tears of pearls include the
idea of metamorphosis, as in "The Light of
the Haram."</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> And precious their tears as that rain from the sky,</div>
 <div class="indent4"> Which turns into pearls as it falls in the sea.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>These lines embody the ancient Hindu superstition
which is also apparent in his "Lines toâ€”:"</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Put off the fatal zone you wear,</div>
 <div class="indent4"> The shining pearls around it</div>
 <div class="verse"> Are tears, that fell from Virtue there,</div>
 <div class="indent4"> The hour when Love unbound it.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In his adoration of female beauty, he often
holds the lustrous gem as a foil to the exceeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>charms of woman, or to lift her to higher esteem
by holding her, for preciousness, above the gem.
Beyond all other things most lovely, only
woman was lovelier yet. In "To weave a Garland
for the Rose," he writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Where is the pearl whose orient lustre</div>
 <div class="verse"> Would not, beside thee, look less bright?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">And in one of the "Odes to Nea," he expresses
the jealous regard of love thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> If I were yonder conch of gold</div>
 <div class="indent4"> And thou the pearl within it placed,</div>
 <div class="verse"> I would not let an eye behold</div>
 <div class="indent4"> The sacred gem my arms embraced.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Of the threads in which the woof of "The
Genius of Harmony" is woven, there is one that
sings thus to the passing of the shuttle:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> To the small rill, that weeps along</div>
 <div class="indent4"> Murmuring o'er beds of pearl.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Betraying as he did so frequently in his poems,
such a high regard for the pearl, it is somewhat
curious that the gem was used descriptively
in connection with himself. N. P. Willis,
describing Thomas Moore as he met him at
Lady Blessington's said of him, "His forehead
shines with the lustre and smooth polish of a
pearl."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>
<p>Schiller takes the gem from the warm touch
of human sentiment and builds it into a grand
conception, poetical but untrue to Nature.
In common with other poets, he credits the
pearl with a play of color seldom found even
to a limited degree though it does occur in the
mother-of-pearl. In "Parables and Riddles,"
he describes the rainbow thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> A bridge of pearls its fabric weaves,</div>
 <div class="indent4"> A gray sea arching proudly over.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">In "The Celebrated Woman" he alludes twice
to pearls; once when the husband, bemoaning
the passage of his choice vintages down the
throats of unappreciative celebrities, realizes
that the only reward from his spouse for his
endurance of it is, "sour looksâ€”deep sighs."
Because he has no stomach for her notables
and their wit, she regretsâ€”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">That such a pearl should fall to swineâ€”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Later on the husband refers satirically to the
meeting of "learned Dons and folks of fashion"
at their resorts, where he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> All sorts of Fame sit cheek-by-jowl,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Pearls in that stringâ€”the Table d'Hote.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Few later writers have set the pearl in as wide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>a range of ideas or in language as beautiful as
Edmund Spenser. The tears of Stella in "The
Mourning Muse of Thestylis" are more precious
and gem-like than those in any lines which have
followed until now. In these lines they are
priceless jewels royally set.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> And from those two bright starres to him sometime so deere,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Her heart sent drops of pearle, which fell in foyson downe</div>
 <div class="verse"> Twixt lilly and the rose.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">As a means to wake imagination to the physical
charms of woman his use of the gem is equally
happy and graceful, for there is always a soul
in the flesh of his beauty as when he depicts
the charms of a fair one in one of his "Sonnets."</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> But fairest she, when so she doth display</div>
 <div class="verse"> The gate with pearles and rubyes richly dight;</div>
 <div class="verse"> Through which her words so wise do make their way</div>
 <div class="verse"> To bear the message of her gentle spright.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">In another place he expresses the worship of
his love in this fashion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> For loe, my love doth in her selfe containe</div>
 <div class="verse"> All this worlds riches that may farre be found;</div>
 <div class="verse"> If Pearles, her teeth be Pearles, both pure and round.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Several of his poems show the fashion of
pearls in his day as for instance where he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>describes the Scarlet Lady in "The Faerie
Queene" asâ€”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> A goodly Lady clad in scarlet red,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Purfled with gold and pearle of rich assay.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and Hymen in "Epithalamion"â€”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Her long loose yellow locks lyke golden wyre,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Sprinckled with perle.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">There is a passing breath of spice-laden gales
and the wonder magic of ships in far-off seas,
carrying to perils and adventure men seeking
the treasures of strange lands, while he tells in
Virgil's Gnat of the shepherd's content:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Ne ought the whelky pearles esteemeth hee,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Which are from Indian seas brought far away.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Poets are reminded not only of the teeth and
neck of beauty by the luster of the pearl but
of the forehead also. Whittier like Tennyson
gives to woman a brow of pearl. In "Memories"
the girl hasâ€”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Eyes glad with smiles, and brow of pearl,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and in "Stanzas," he places the beauty of flesh
above that of the dainty jewel thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> O'er a forehead more pure than the Parian stoneâ€”</div>
 <div class="verse"> Shaming the light of those Orient pearls</div>
 <div class="verse"> Which bind o'er its whiteness thy soft wreathing curls.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly Heinrich Heine in Longfellow's translation
of "The Sea hath its Pearls" says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> And fairer than pearls and stars</div>
 <div class="indent4"> Flashes and beams my love.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Probably in no poem is the pearl referred to so
frequently or with so wide significance as in
Whittier's "The Vaudois Teacher." The missionary
in his guise of peddler having obtained
an audience with the fair chatelaine, while
extolling his wares, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And my pearls are pure as thy own fair neck, with whose</div>
<div class="indent17">radiant light they vie.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Naturally, this wisdom of the serpent with
which his innocence was garnished brought
favorable response:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">And the lady smiled on the worn old man through the</div>
 <div class="indent15">dark and clustering curls,</div>
 <div class="verse">Which veiled her brow as she bent to view his silks and</div>
 <div class="indent17">glittering pearls.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">After she had bought of his trinkets, the old
teacher carefully introduces the covered object
of his visit.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Oh, lady fair, I have yet a gem which a purer lustre flings,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Than the diamond flash of the jewelled crown on the lofty brow of Kings,</div>
 <div class="verse"> A wonderful pearl of exceeding price, whose virtue shall not decay.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">This statement at once arouses a keen interest,
for in those days great gems came from unexpected
sources and by unlikely hands and
coming seldom, excited desire to an extent
unknown in these abundant times. Glancing
at the mirrored pearls in her own hair the
lady says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Bring forth thy pearl of exceeding worth, thou traveller gray and oldâ€”</div>
 <div class="verse"> And name the price of thy precious gem, and my page shall count thy gold.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Here is the golden opportunity of the zealot.
From its place of concealment beneath the
tempting wares in his pack he takes a shabby
little book and gives it to her saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Here, lady fair, is the pearl of price, may it proove as such to thee,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Nayâ€”keep thy goldâ€”I ask it not; for the Word of God is free!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Nor does the religious mind of Whittier fail to
remember the gates of pearl, for in "Ego" he
speaks of</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The pearl gates of the Better Land.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Carlyle makes reference to the gem in a line
greater in conception and more poetic than most
of those which occur in the rhymes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>poetsâ€”"She died in beauty, like a pearl dropped
from some diadem."</p>

<p>In Ruffini's "Dr. Antonio," man and woman
are set in marriage as a foil and complement of
each other though the metaphor shows some
misunderstanding of the qualities of gems, for
black diamonds are not as fiery as others. The
lines are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The fiery black diamond casting lustre over the
Oriental pearl: the Oriental pearl in return lending
softness to the black diamond.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Dryden does not forget pearls when he caparisons
the royal mighty and in "Palamon and
Arcite" fitly thus describes Emetrius, King of
Inde:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> His surcoat o'er his arms was cloth of Thrace,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Adorned with pearls all orient, round and great.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">It is remarkable that so many poets have seen
in the pearl a simile for raindrops and dew.
Among them, Browning in the song from
"Pippa Passes," seesâ€”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The hill-side's dew-pearled.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">At its best, the pearl is not luminous, neither
does it flash nor sparkle: the quality of it is
softly lustrous as of light that smolders; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>transferring by imagery the mist-white texture
of dew when it is spread over leaf and grass
blade, to the transparent dew-drop, poets see
in the sparkling globule, which in the sun is of
diamantine brilliancy, a simile of the pearl.</p>

<p>In "By the Fireside" however, Browning
creates a rain of pearls, a truer figure than
pearly raindrops:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="indent4"> Break the rosary in a pearly rain,</div>
 <div class="verse"> And gather what we let fall.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">The metaphors of Lowell are more true to the
nature of the pearl and its characteristics than
those of many poets. One, seldom used though
most appropriate, occurs in "The First Snow
Fall."</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> And the poorest twig on the elm-tree</div>
 <div class="indent4"> Was ridged inch deep with pearl.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Another instance of combined truth and poetry
may be found in "An Invitation":</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> A cloud Byzantium newly born,</div>
 <div class="verse"> With flickering spires and dome of pearl.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">And in "Pictures from Appledore" the same
poet in the embodiment of a delightful idea in
words says of the moon:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Rather to call it the canoe</div>
 <div class="verse"> Hollowed out of a single pearl.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">In these illustrations, imagination is true to
nature on either hand, for the beady ridges of
the half melted or frozen snow on the tree
twigs, the soft luster of a white cloud dome
and the pale round moon, alike are characterized
by beauties which are pearly. In his more
involved metaphor the same nice avoidance of
incongruity is noticeable. Though raindrops
are not pearly, the white fringe of a shore-driven
wave is, which he notes in "Sea-Weed":</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> For the same wave that rims the Carib shore</div>
 <div class="verse"> With momentary brede of pearl and gold.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">There is a hint of Cleopatra and Sir Thomas
Gresham in his lines "To H. W. L."</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Let them drink molten pearls nor dream the cost;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and in the lines from "Memoria Positum"
there is an understanding of the processes by
which the gem grows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="indent4"> This death hath far choicer ends</div>
 <div class="verse"> Than slowly to impearl in hearts of friends;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and in the poetic fancy in "A Familiar Epistle to
a Friend"â€”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Old sorrows crystallized into pearls.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Nor does he omit the time-honored custom of
poets to place the gem among the chief jewels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>of the great and in the mouth of beauty, for
in "The Singing Leaves" he makes the King's
eldest daughter ask of her royal father when he
journeys:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O, bring me pearls and diamonds great,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and in "A Fable for Critics" he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Your goddess of freedom, a tight, buxom girl,</div>
 <div class="verse"> With lips like a cherry and teeth like a pearl.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Bryant does not often allude to pearls, but in
two instances, both in "The Flood of Years,"
they appear in beautiful setting. In the first:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> A beam like that of moonlight turns the spray</div>
 <div class="verse"> To glistening pearls.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Later on, describing the ocean of the past, he
seesâ€”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Dim glimmerings of lost jewels, far within</div>
 <div class="verse"> The sleeping waters, diamond, sardonyx,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Ruby and topaz, pearl and chrysolite.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">The general use of pearls in the barbaric splendor
of the great in the days of Rome and Egypt
and Persia, appears in Tasso's "Jerusalem
Delivered." In the wizard's dwelling:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Nor failed there urns of crystal, pearl, and gold,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> High on the Soldan's helm, in scales of pearl</div>
 <div class="indent4"> A rampant dragon grinn'd malignant things;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and also,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="indent10"> The Pastors of the flocks</div>
 <div class="verse"> Have on their sacerdotal albs, which pass</div>
 <div class="verse"> In front divided o'er their golden frocks,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Clasp'd with aigraffes of pearl.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">In the review of the oriental hordes, Armida's
car is thus described,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> Her car, that glorious as Aurora's roll'd,</div>
 <div class="verse"> With rubies, pearls, and hyacinths glisten'd clear.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Among those who passed the Egyptian prince,
were:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="indent8"> The Islanders with fleecy curls,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Whose homes are compassed by th' Arabian waves;</div>
 <div class="verse"> By whom those shells which breed the Persian pearls</div>
 <div class="verse"> Are dived and fish'd for, in their green sea caves.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">The name of the gem is used in rare fashion in
picturing the enchanted wood through which
Rinaldo wanders:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Impearl'd with manna was each fresh leaf nigh.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">And twice does the sweat of the human face
become pearly in the poet's imagination: once
when Armida watches Rinaldo sleeping:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse"> The living heat-dews that impearl'd his face,</div>
 <div class="verse"> She with her veil wiped tenderly away.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">In the second instance, speaking of Armida,
the poet says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
 <div class="indent18"> She dies</div>
 <div class="verse"> Of the sweet passion, and the heat that pearls,</div>
 <div class="verse"> Yet more her ardent aspect beautifies.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>
<p>Thomson sees pearls only in the dew-impearled
earth, and one must admit, after looking upon
the liquid globules hanging in rows from the
spreading twigs of trees before the morning sun
has found them in their shaded quarters, that
the pendent spheres are suggestive, and that
the poet's eye needs but little assistance from
imagination to see in them the soft round gems
of the ocean.</p>

<p>In all ages, prose and fiction have treated of
pearls as a form of exceeding preciousness and a
chief evidence of high station and barbaric
splendor. The lute of poetry has held few
additional strings. Modern writers have added
little to the imaginations of the ancients. All
the changes made by successive poets have been
rung on the tears, dew-drops, and beauty's
teeth, handed down from long ago.</p>

<p>The wide ranges of the pearl's modest worth,
exalted purity, and singular beauty, yet remain
to illustrate the thoughts of future genius.
Imagination has not yet brooded often over the
humble and distorted creatures, whose gnarled
and twisted forms, lying among their myriad
shapely brethren are evidence of a precious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>sacrifice of self to leave a heritage of beauty;
nor dreamed of the silent acres under turbulent
waters where the gem, one day to adorn the
neck of beauty or the diadem of royalty, is
reared. What play for imagination lies between
the birth of this creation of one of the humblest
of Earth's creatures, and the high placement
to which it rises as soon as it is discovered.</p>

<p>There are deserted wastes of sand and water
under torrid skies, populated almost momentarily
with teeming multitudes whose jargon
fills the former silences with a world wide
medley of tongues. As in a dream, the tremulous
air is stirred by the struggling movement
of naked slaves, turbanned orientals, men from
all lands of the occident, the moving throng
weaving constantly new patterns from the
variegated colors and fantastic costumes of living
threads. And everywhere, beneath the
prosaic motion of labor and trading, is the
quiver of hope, the excitement of the gambler;
the poetry of human passions, unseen, but felt.</p>

<p>There are in unfrequented seas, where some
lonely atoll draws its circle round a still lagoon,
treasures greater than its cargo and the stately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>ship sailing heedless by. So like the undiscovered
pearls of the ocean's bed, the universe
holds an exhaustless store of thoughts and
truths for those who come after the discoverers
of this age. Thought runs in grooves and the
grooves outlast many generations; scarcely in
a cycle does one look over the ridge and find a
species foreign to the rut.</p>

<p>Within the walls which the past builds for
the present it is more easy to adopt than to
bring forth, and so the ancient metaphors, age
after age, are with some changes of raiment
thrown back upon the world again. But in
this new era of acquisition, while this sea-gem
is again lifted to the serene heights of most
exalted favor, perhaps it will not only shine
upon the persons of the fair, but adorn, in
simile and metaphor as beautiful as the old,
the pages of romance and poetry.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
